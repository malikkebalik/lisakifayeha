Well, yes, he did and he regrets it. He got an eyelid lift surgery when he saw too many lines coming in at the side of his eyes. He hoped to have fresher-looking eyes but he ended up having too far eyelids that made him look worse than before. The Gambler hitmaker admitted to the procedure and said that he regretted him. Since then, Kenny Rogers' plastic surgery is one of the things that is most talked about when it comes to him. He is also suspected of having a facelift, a nose job, and an eyebrow lift.</strong></p><p><strong>Kenny Rogers</strong> was one of the greatest and most versatile <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>artists</strong></a> the world has ever seen. The American singer and songwriter dabbled into every genre seamlessly like he owned it, and excelled at it. His career and fame spanned multiple genres including jazz, folk, pop, rock, and country. His contribution to country music as well as jazz and rock is immense and celebrated. He was one of the most successful crossover artists of all time.</p><p>Though Kenny Rogers was most popular with country audiences because he started country (he was even inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2013), he has charted more than 120 hit singles across varied genres. He topped the country and pop album chart for more than 200 individual weeks in the United States alone. He also sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time.</p><p>He had an incredible career and had great hits he sang and charmed audiences with. But, now people remember him more for his botched plastic surgery than for his legacy. It's a sad thing but cosmetic surgery has really consumed pop culture today. He got work done that didn't work out the way he wanted it to. And for bad and for worse, he openly admitted to it, which gave it even more coverage, making people talk about that. Let's talk about Kenny Rogers' plastic surgery!</p><p>Also, check out the <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>plastic surgery</strong></a> stories of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Hailey Bieber</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Sarah Parish</strong></a>.</p><h2>Did Kenny Rogers Have Plastic Surgery? The Gambler Singer Did and He Regretted it!</h2><p><strong>Kenny Rogers</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@_kennyrogers</a>) has had plastic surgery and he also has regrets about that because it didn't work out the way he had expected it to and it only ended up making him look ridiculous. He admitted to having an <strong>eyelid lift</strong>. Others suspect he has had more he had not admitted to, including a <strong>nose job</strong>, <strong>brow lift</strong>, and a <strong>facelift</strong>.</p><p>Kenny Rogers struggled with the effects of aging as he grew older. He was always popular with the ladies because of his looks. With time, he was less sure and he must not have liked that because he was super conscious of his image. In his book Luck or Something Like It, he mentioned that when he became aware and conscious of his professional image, he learned that <a href=# rel=noopener>reinventing himself would be necessary for him</a> to thrive in his career and remain relevant. Was that a sign that he would go on to get plastic surgery because it sure looked like that?</p><p>Kenny Rogers once said he felt the need to revamp himself to compete with youthful newcomers in the music scene, much younger and more energetic than him. He didn't want to show people that he was aging and the signs were there. The wrinkles, the lines, the crow's feet, and the dropping and the sagging created a fear in him that his time in music would come to an end if he didn't make a change. So, he went ahead and got plastic surgery to look younger.</p><p>Only, it made the singer look worse. The plastic surgery he had was not subtle and didn't have the effect he hoped it would have, and it made him look weird. Kenny Rogers immediately regretted the eyelid lift he had. He said that he went to get his eyes done because he saw many lines coming in at the side of his eyes but little did he know, it was better like that.</p><p>Kenny Rogers looked scruffy and masculine with his old eyes but after he got the plastic surgery to lift his eyelid to make his eyes look like when he was younger, it took the essence of his looks away because he no longer looked like that. With his tight eyelids, he looked a bit weird because it kind of changed the shape of his eyes and his brows were shortened too like they had been cut off. All in all, the job he got done was regrettable because he did it <a href=# rel=noopener>all for the sake of looking better</a> and the results were the opposite of that.</p><p>In 2006, the I Can't Unlove You hitmaker opened up in an interview about his plastic surgery. He told People that he wasn't pleased with the results of his eye job. Kenny Rogers was not happy about it and he said it. He also said that he was going to get it fixed because it drove him crazy that his eyes were too tight around the eyelids for him. If he could get it fixed, it would be okay but if he could not fix that mess, he would <a href=# rel=noopener>regret the plastic surgery</a> even more and have to get used to it.</p><p>In a 2012 sit-down with CBS This Morning, Kenny Rogers gave more details about that disaster of plastic surgery and said that his decision was partly out of boredom and partly in an attempt to change his image during a career lull. He had all the means and he was like, 'why not give it a try?'</p><p><strong>I had the money to do it and I had time off. You look at yourself and you go ‘could I be better if I did this or I did that?’ And I did it, and the guy who did it was one of the world’s best. But he just had this concept that the edge of your eyes had to be higher than a certain place. And I regret that. But the truth is, I don't know what I would have looked like if I hadn't done it. I could be all down here. You do it, or you live with it.</strong></p><p>Kenny Rogers <a href=# rel=noopener>gambled with plastic surgery</a> and he lost, <strong>Dr. Youn</strong> says, but he is still one of the greatest musicians that ever lived. He was also accused of a facelift, a nose job, and an eyebrow lift but that botched eyelid lift hogged all the attention that nobody took the time to see if he appeared to have those procedures done.</p><p><strong>If you want to read more <a href=#>interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs, <a href=#>House & Whips</a> is at your service.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGiinqaernqzu8aeqaxloKGutMDInGSsraKcsrPFjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-the-singer-have-an-eyelid-lift-surgery.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-the-singer-have-an-eyelid-lift-surgery.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-the-singer-have-an-eyelid-lift-surgery.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-the-singer-have-an-eyelid-lift-surgery.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-the-singer-have-an-eyelid-lift-surgery.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-the-singer-have-an-eyelid-lift-surgery.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./difference-between-angel-and-archangel.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./difference-between-angel-and-archangel.html>Difference Between Angel And Archangel</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./daisy-de-la-hoya-age-wiki-bio-boyfriend-net-worth-tatoo.html>Daisy de la Hoya Age, Wiki-Bio, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Tatoo</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./daisy-de-la-hoya-age-wiki-bio-boyfriend-net-worth-tatoo.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
