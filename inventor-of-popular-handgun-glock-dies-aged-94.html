He later founded a consumer goods business in a town outside the Austrian capital.</p><p>In the early 1980s, the business branched into military supplies and answered a call from the Austrian army that was looking to update its pistols.</p><p>Glock designed and patented a lightweight 9-millimetre semi automatic handgun, which could fire 18 rounds and be easily reloaded.</p><p>The gun gained a loyal following among military and police personnel worldwide.</p><p>Paul Barrett, the author of Glock: The Rise of America’s Gun, wrote that the weapon had become “the Google of modern civilian handguns: the pioneer brand that defines its product category”.</p><p>Forbes estimated Glock’s personal fortune at $1.1bn (£858,800) in 2021.</p><p>The Glock also found a place in US pop culture. “Get yourself a Glock and lose that nickel-plated sissy pistol,” actor Tommy Lee Jones said in the 1998 movie US Marshals.</p><p>American rappers Snoop Dogg and Wu-Tang Clan also worked the gun into their rhymes.</p><p>The weapon was also featured in Hollywood blockbusters including action films Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines and The Matrix Reloaded.</p><p>Over the years, gun-control advocates have criticised Glock for popularising a weapon which was easy to conceal, all while holding more ammunition than similar guns.</p><p>It has received its share of controversy. The Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was found by US soldiers hiding with a Glock in a hole in the ground in 2003.</p><p>In 2018, a US Marine Corps veteran with suspected mental health issues killed 12 people in a busy bar in California including a policeman.</p><p>Ian David Long legally owned a Glock semi-automatic handgun, which had an extended magazine that is illegal in the state of California.</p><p>Meanwhile, a US gun company faced backlash for producing a customised Glock pistol that looked like a children’s toy made of Lego.</p><p>Glock rarely responded to criticism from gun control campaigners. He also refused to join other weapon manufacturers who signed a voluntary gun control deal with the US government in 2000.</p><p>He is survived by his wife, a daughter and two sons.</p><p>By BBC News</p><b>Email your news TIPS to Editor@kahawatungu.com or WhatsApp +254707482874</b><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmijkZ2uuK3TrqWgrV6YvK57yKetnqakpL9uu8Vmp6iopaGus3nHmqWdn6Wjeqi4zpyiZpyZmsBurcaem2ZxZGQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finventor-of-popular-handgun-glock-dies-aged-94.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2finventor-of-popular-handgun-glock-dies-aged-94.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2finventor-of-popular-handgun-glock-dies-aged-94.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2finventor-of-popular-handgun-glock-dies-aged-94.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finventor-of-popular-handgun-glock-dies-aged-94.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2finventor-of-popular-handgun-glock-dies-aged-94.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jack-brinkman-bio-wiki.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jack-brinkman-bio-wiki.html>Jack Brinkman Bio (Wiki)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./height-and-all-you-need-to-know-about-jeff-cavaliere-the-athlean-x-guy.html>Height and all you need to know about Jeff Cavaliere the Athlean X guy</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./height-and-all-you-need-to-know-about-jeff-cavaliere-the-athlean-x-guy.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
