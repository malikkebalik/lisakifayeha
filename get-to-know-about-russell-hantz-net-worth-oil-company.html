<time>23 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>If you are a fan of the American reality show&nbsp;<i>Survivor</i>, then you might be familiar with the name&nbsp;<strong>Russell Hantz</strong>. He is often regarded by many as one of the most blatant participants who ever participated in the show. Hantz is known for competing three times in the American version of the show and once in the&nbsp;<i>Australian Survivor</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of his rude and self-assertive gameplay techniques and intentions to create chaos in the camps, Hantz is one of the fan favorites of the&nbsp;<i>Survivor</i>&nbsp;series. Viewers voted him for "Sprint Player of the season".&nbsp;</p><p>However, these behaviors made him lose both season finales as his fellow tribes promptly voted him out at the Tribal Council.&nbsp;</p><h2>Married & Divorced Melanie Hantz: But Why?</h2><p><i>Survivor</i>&nbsp;star Hantz is a divorced man. Previously, he was in a married relationship with, <strong>Melanie Hantz</strong>. His ex-wife has made several appearances in a couple of episodes of&nbsp;<i>Survivor&nbsp;</i>as Hantz's wife.&nbsp;</p><p>Hantz and his ex-wife were living a long and happy married life and had welcomed four children from their marriage relation including his twin daughters <strong>Hannah Hantz</strong> and <strong>Hailey Hantz</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/10/22/marriage-hantz-min-1663916513198%20(1)%20(1)-1666419416904.jpeg><p>However, when Hantz returned home after <i>Survivor</i>, not things were the same between the couple. They often fought with each other before finally getting a divorce in 2014.&nbsp;</p><p>Hantz often blames the show and the main reason he got separated from his wife was the show's fault. In an interview with <i>Who magazine</i>, he stated</p><p>I went home and pretty much ignored everything, including my relationship with my wife, I lost my marriage due to this show.</p><p>Although he was very sad when separating from his ex-wife at the beginning, he has currently moved on and is currently dating <strong>Taylor King</strong>.</p><h2>Rumors: Ongoing Relationship & Hookup of Hantz&nbsp;</h2><p>In the same interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow><i>Who</i></a>, Hantz claims he is on good terms with his ex-wife Melanie Hantz and things between them cooled down. Even though things between them settled out, the possibilities of their reunion as a couple are minimal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/23/russellongoing-min-1663920909773.jpg><p>When asked about his current relationship status, he refused to answer. According to rumors, Russell Hantz is dating a stunning lady<strong> </strong>Taylor King, who is a bartender and bikini competitor by profession.&nbsp;</p><p>However, he has not revealed anything regarding her current relationship and refused to address the talks.</p><h2>About Russell Hantz's Net Worth & Earnings</h2><p>As we all know, Hantz got his fame for participating in the reality show, <i>Survivor</i>. However, he was already rich before joining the show. In one of the episodes of the reality show, he claims he was not there to win or take the prize pool, but he was there to show us how easy it is to win the show.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/23/russellnetworth-1663921324721.jpg><p>Hantz has not disclosed his earnings or any information about his wealth to the media till now. According to the latest research and estimation, the net worth of Russell Hantz is&nbsp;<strong>$2 million</strong> like <a href=# rel=nofollow>Munro Chambers</a>. Most of his earnings came from his oil business and <i>Survivor</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>US magazine states the final two of the show Survivor get $100 thousand, and the winner gets a whooping prize pool of&nbsp;$1 million. As Hantz became the runner-up twice, he won&nbsp;$200 thousand&nbsp;in two seasons. Also, he got the&nbsp;<i>Sprint Player of the season</i>, which is worth&nbsp;$100 thousand.</p><h2>Childhood & Early Life</h2><p>Russell Hantz was born on&nbsp;<strong>October 10, 1972</strong>, in Dayton, Texas, United States. Later his family, including his father, mother, and two brothers, Shawn and Willie Hantz, moved to Vinton, Louisiana, United States. So, he spent most of his early life and childhood in Louisiana.</p><p>Hantz had done his alma mater from the high school nearby Vinton like <a href=# rel=nofollow>Rebecca Kopelman</a>. He was interested in fishing and farming, so his father trained him in shrimping and oystering to make him involved in the family business.&nbsp;</p><h2>Hantz's Career In The TV Show "Survivor"</h2><p>Hantz, known as the villain of the entire history of <i>Survivor </i>for betraying his fellows and doing ruthless activities, joined the series in <strong>2009</strong>. Since then, he has participated in three seasons in <strong>2009</strong>, <strong>2010</strong>, and <strong>2011</strong>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/23/survivor-1663921157632.jpeg><p>He was the first runner-up in <i>Survivor: Samoa</i> in 2009 and the second runner-up in <i>Survivor: Heroes Vs. Villain</i> in 2010. In February 2010, Hantz made his appearance on<i>&nbsp;Late Show with David Letterman</i>&nbsp;as Top Ten List Presenter #9.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2018, after seven years of his last appearance in <i>Survivor</i>, he participated in Australian <i>Survivor: Champions Vs. Contenders</i> as a Champion Tribe. Unfortunately, he was vote-kicked and eliminated in the 23rd position.&nbsp;</p><h2>Does Russell Hantz Own an Oil Company?</h2><p>Apart from being a famous TV personality, Russell Hantz is also a quality businessman who owns an oil company with his father and brothers. But there have been a lot of questions in the mind of the public, whether he actually owns a company or not.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to his lying and betraying attitude in the show, most survivor fans think he is probably lying. However, there are little shreds of evidence that he is probably telling the truth.&nbsp;</p><p>The company Hantz claims he owns is&nbsp;<strong>Hantz Tankering Service, LLC</strong>, which is officially listed on Google Maps, and you can easily watch the satellite view of the company located in Dayton, Texas. It is also listed in OpenCorporates, the open database of the corporate world.&nbsp;</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=#>OpenCorporates</a>, the company was registered with the company number<strong>&nbsp;0801076718</strong>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<strong>January 21, 2009</strong>, and dissolved on&nbsp;<strong>July 27, 2012</strong>.</p><p>These pieces of little evidence only support that Hantz is an oil executive, but the lack of concrete evidence still puts the fans in a dilemma.&nbsp;</p><h2>Presence In Social Media</h2><p>The self-claimed part owner of Hantz Tankering Service, LLC, Hantz seems hyperactive on the internet, especially on Twitter. His official and verified Twitter handle, <a href=# rel=nofollow>@russellhantz</a>, has more than <strong>50K </strong>followers. Usually, he tweets four to five times a day. Once, he posts his family photo on his social handles.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/23/familyhantz-1663917097441.jpeg><p>Hantz has dropped the link to his official youtube channel in his Twitter bio. His YouTube handle name is <a href=# rel=nofollow>@THE RUSSELL HANTZ SHOW</a>, which has over forty thousand subscribers.&nbsp;</p><h2>Controversies & Scandals of Hantz</h2><p>The multimillionaire <i>Survivor</i> star, Hantz, was a part of a massive controversy for spoiling the details and results of <i>Samoa</i> and <i>Heroes Vs. Villains</i> in 2011.&nbsp;</p><p>Jim Early, the spoiler giver, accused Russell Hantz of being the source. He claimed that Hantz gave both fake about Carrie Prejean and Kimbo Slice and actual spoilers about Krista Klumpp and Ashley Underwood.</p><p>Giving spoilers of such confidential data before its release is a legal crime, according to the contract between <i>Survivor </i>and Hantz. Per the contract, there will be a&nbsp;<strong>$5 million</strong>&nbsp;lawsuit for breaching those pieces of information.&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, Hantz denied the accusations, and later the case was dismissed due to a lack of evidence and cooperation from the accused.&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>For more interesting and exciting biographies, make sure to check </strong></i><a href=# rel=nofollow><i><strong>MarriedCeleb</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqusrKuVoblutMCnq7M%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fget-to-know-about-russell-hantz-net-worth-oil-company.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fget-to-know-about-russell-hantz-net-worth-oil-company.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fget-to-know-about-russell-hantz-net-worth-oil-company.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fget-to-know-about-russell-hantz-net-worth-oil-company.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fget-to-know-about-russell-hantz-net-worth-oil-company.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fget-to-know-about-russell-hantz-net-worth-oil-company.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kristen-wilson.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kristen-wilson.html>Kristen Wilson</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./former-staff-member-of-camp-wow-hayden-stanley-meatball-passes-away.html>Former staff member of Camp WOW Hayden Stanley Meatball passes away</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./former-staff-member-of-camp-wow-hayden-stanley-meatball-passes-away.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
