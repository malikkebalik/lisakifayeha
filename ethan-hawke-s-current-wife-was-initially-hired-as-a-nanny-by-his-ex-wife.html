However, after a short period, Shawhughes <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">moved back</a> to Columbia to get her degree.&nbsp;</span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span>At the time, the then Hawke couple were having trouble in their marriage. Eventually, they </span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>parted ways</span></a><span> in 2005 after seven years of conjugal relationship.</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Three years later, Hawke married Shawhughes in a quiet New York ceremony in the summer of 2008. Despite being seen wearing wedding bands, the pair initially dismissed reports about their marital status.</p><p>However, after <span>much anticipation</span>, the artist's then-a<span>gent, Mara Buxbaum, confirmed the wedding in June 2008. Al</span>so, Shawhughes was spotted with a growing baby bump while walking their dog in Greenwich Village, New York<span>.&nbsp;</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Soon, the couple was blessed with their first child, Clementine Jane Hawke, born in July 2008. The Boyhood star became a dad for the fourth time in July 2011, when his wife gave birth to <span>their second daughter, Indiana Hawke.&nbsp;</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><img alt height=577 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com/uploads/images/Ethan-Hawke-Festival-de-Venise-Mostra-wife-ryan.png width=600 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Hawke with wife Ryan at the 2009&nbsp;Venice International Film Festival</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Wikimedia Commons</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Cheating Allegations</h2><p>Despite widespread rumors that The Purge star was unfaithful to Thurman, he publicly claimed that their relationship failed for reasons unrelated to his second wife. Also, he still maintains that he started dating Shawhughes only after his divorce was finalized in 2005.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>There were never any scandalous thoughts or actions back then. In the years that followed, my marriage disintegrated due to many pressures, none of which were remotely connected to Ryan.</p><p>In 2009, he told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Guardian</a> that the two met again at a park around a year later after his split. When Shawhughes asked him out, the actor couldn't deny it. "The truth is, by the time Ryan and I were falling in love, it had been a long while since I had employed her,"&nbsp;he continued.</p><p>Nonetheless, when he made some unguarded remarks about sexual fidelity not being an important part of a relationship, he received harsh criticism. In a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">2013 interview </a>with Mr. Porter, the Before Midnight actor said, "Sexual fidelity can't be the whole thing you hang your relationship on. "</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>"People have such a childish view of monogamy and fidelity. 'He's cheated, so he's bad, she's cheated so she's bad,' as opposed to a recognition that our species is not monogamous," Hawke added. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Meanwhile, Shawhughes has stood by her husband over the years and even got his initials EGH (Ethan Green Hawke) tattooed on her arm.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Hawke's&nbsp;Relationship with His Children</h2><p>Despite his separation from his first wife, Thurman, the father of four has maintained a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">stable relationship</a> with his children and has managed to build a happy blended family with his now-wife.</p><p>In fact, the family spent their quarantine days together entertaining themselves with singing and dancing. Maya, 22, his eldest daughter, took to her Instagram account to share the beautiful family bonding<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">video </a>in March 2020.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>While Hawke and his son, Levon,19, were seen playing the guitar, his three gorgeous daughters sang Townes Van Sandy's song 'To Live Is To Fly' alongside their father.</p><p>Following their parent's footsteps, Maya and Levon both found their way to Hollywood. Maya&nbsp;is&nbsp;an actress who has worked on projects like Little Women,&nbsp;Stranger Things, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, etc. Similarly, Levon has appeared in the movie Blackout and will soon be seen in Netflix's Stranger Things Season 4.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnlam1orqMoZiwo5Woeri1xZ5kp5meo8ZusMCunqGslad7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fethan-hawke-s-current-wife-was-initially-hired-as-a-nanny-by-his-ex-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fethan-hawke-s-current-wife-was-initially-hired-as-a-nanny-by-his-ex-wife.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fethan-hawke-s-current-wife-was-initially-hired-as-a-nanny-by-his-ex-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fethan-hawke-s-current-wife-was-initially-hired-as-a-nanny-by-his-ex-wife.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fethan-hawke-s-current-wife-was-initially-hired-as-a-nanny-by-his-ex-wife.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fethan-hawke-s-current-wife-was-initially-hired-as-a-nanny-by-his-ex-wife.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./get-to-know-about-nat-faxon-teeth-net-worth-wife.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./get-to-know-about-nat-faxon-teeth-net-worth-wife.html>Get To Know About Nat Faxon Teeth, Net Worth &amp;amp; Wife</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./braves-continue-relentless-pace-as-matt-olson-s-grand-slam-fuels-rout-of-white-sox.html>Braves continue relentless pace as Matt Olsons grand slam fuels rout of White Sox</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./braves-continue-relentless-pace-as-matt-olson-s-grand-slam-fuels-rout-of-white-sox.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
