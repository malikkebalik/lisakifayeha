Nasheed also developed dating protocols using his skills. Additionally, he gave them the name G.I.C.2 (game, intelligence, and common sense, squared).</p><p>The media expert also incorporated lessons he had learned from other people and psychological books into his counsel. As a result, he agreed to take a job as a gaming counselor and began imparting his strategies to many others in Los Angeles. Furthermore, his book’s main focus ultimately shifted to relationship advice.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table style=height:100%;width:100%><tbody><tr><td><strong>Full Real Name</strong></td><td>Tariq nasheed</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nickname</strong></td><td>Tariq</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age (as of 2021)</strong></td><td>47 years old</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Producer, Social media commentator</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date of birth</strong></td><td>July 1, 1974</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Place of Birth</strong></td><td>Detroit, Michigan, United States</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ethnicity</strong></td><td>Mixed</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Religion</strong></td><td>Christian.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Wife</strong></td><td>Peanut Nasheed</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net worth</strong></td><td>$10 million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(approx.)</strong></td><td>6 ft 2 inches</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight (approx.)</strong></td><td>60 Kg</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=Is_Tariq_Nasheed_Married_Wife>Is Tariq Nasheed Married?

On the Billboard R&B Albums list in 2018, the album came in at number 12.</p><p>Additionally, Nasheed co-wrote the song “Your Touch” with APX’s main singer Erika Dawn. The APX was the one who made it. In addition, Nasheed hosts talk programs and motivational workshops based on his book, “The Art of Mackin.”</p><p>The Mack Lessons Radio Show was created by Mack Lessons because he routinely sells out his venues. The show’s and podcast’s subscriber count is over 100,000.
