The actress is extremely private and has never revealed who her partner is. There was a rumor about Cheri Oteri being in a relationship with Alec Baldwin, who is now husband to Hilaria Baldwin, years ago, which was unconfirmed.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Being in the public eye automatically generates a lot of interest in you whether it is something you do, something you wear, or especially someone you date. Relationships and gossip about who's dating who is something people are largely invested in for no clear-cut reason. There is always curiosity among the public about the love life of celebrities.</p><p>And likewise, there is a lot of curiosity about the love life of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Cheri Oteri</strong></a>. Fans want to know the relationship status of the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>former SNL alum</a></strong>; is she single, or is she dating someone, if she is, who is her partner, or she could be married as well, in that case, who is her husband? The <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>actress</strong></a> has never opened up about her love life but there are rumors!</p><h2>Is Cheri Oteri Married? Who Is Her Husband? Details of The Comedian's Partner and The Rumors of Relationship With Alec Baldwin!</h2><p>Exactly who is <strong>Cheri Oteri</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@cheri_oteri</a>) married to and if she is, who is her husband might be a difficult question to answer because she is just so private, even for a public figure. But that makes fans want to know about her partner even more. Whether they will get the information about it is not certain, however.</p><p>And about Cheri Oteri, like already mentioned, she's an extremely private person whose personal life is very much unknown to the public. So, the details of her relationship status are not available to the public as she is not the kind of person who would reveal it. The secretive SNL alum has never opened up about who she's dating or who she's married to, if at all. So, the public doesn't even know if she has a partner who she is just dating or if she has a fiancee, or if she has a husband.</p><p>In her decades-long career, Cheri Oteri has not once opened up about her relationship. For all we know, she's always married to her secret husband who nobody knows. Maybe that's why there are no rumors of her dating anyone because she won't as she already has a husband to go home to. This kind of mystery surrounding her love life has generated a lot of rumors about her marital status, past relationships, her partners, and her sexual orientation as well.</p><p>One such rumor about Cheri Oteri's relationship is that she was once involved with <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong>, who is now husband to <strong>Hilaria Baldwin</strong>. Now that is not a concrete truth because none of the people involved ever came forward and confirmed those speculations. So, take everything about this relationship with her supposed partner Alec Baldwin with a grain of salt.</p><p>So, the rumor of their much-talked-about relationship that people still don't know for sure if it is true or not goes like this; Cheri Oteri met Alec Baldwin through one of the points of their commonality which is Saturday Night Live. She used to be a regular cast till 2000 and Alec too had been a part of the show. They met on the sets of SNL and hit it off and began dating soon.</p><p>The rumor didn't go deeper and there were no questions like could Alec Baldwin be her future husband. But it had quite a buzz then. Though the subjects of the rumor themselves never confirmed their relationship, lots of people believed otherwise. People think that though their dating might not have ended in marriage and Alec never became her husband, but still they were very serious.</p><p>There are many stories about Alec Baldwin and Cheri Oteri being spotted together on various occasions but none of them have been verified. Alec is now happily married to his partner Hilaria Baldwin now.</p><p>Cheri recently had an interaction with her rumored former partner. She voiced her <a href=# rel=noopener>support for him</a> during the investigation on the sets of Alec's upcoming movie Rust which had to be held after he shot a real loaded gun killing one and injuring another in the process.</p><p><strong>I am so sorry Alec. I will pray for all involved. Stay strong and surround yourself with people you love.</strong></p><p>Another rumor is that Cheri Oteri has a non-celebrity husband so, she prefers to keep the spotlight away from him, which is why there is no information about who she's married to or who she's dating.</p><p>Also, Cheri Oteri was believed to be dating a man named <strong>Johnny</strong> in 2020. Apparently, they were very close and were very likely to go from being partners to husband and wife if the rumors are to be believed. That never came to be, it seems like. And lately, there is absolutely no information about who she's dating. So, we don't know if she is single or if she has a partner.</p><p data-changed=false data-paragraphid=6><strong>Visit&nbsp;<a href=#>House & Whips</a>&nbsp;for more&nbsp;<a href=#>interesting stories</a>&nbsp;about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGiaoZ2innqwwMSroGagpaivorrDZqeaqqSjsrN7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-comedian-s-partner-who-is-she-married-to.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-comedian-s-partner-who-is-she-married-to.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-comedian-s-partner-who-is-she-married-to.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-comedian-s-partner-who-is-she-married-to.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-comedian-s-partner-who-is-she-married-to.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-comedian-s-partner-who-is-she-married-to.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./never-heard-of-it-rob-mcelhenney-pokes-fun-at-megflix-ahead-of-meeting-with-king-charles-and-ca.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./never-heard-of-it-rob-mcelhenney-pokes-fun-at-megflix-ahead-of-meeting-with-king-charles-and-ca.html>'Never heard of it': Rob McElhenney pokes fun at 'Megflix' ahead of meeting with King Charles and Ca</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./is-colin-farrell-dating-anyone-now-looking-at-actor-s-prior-relationships.html>Is Colin Farrell Dating Anyone Now?
