As of December 2022, he had also played a solitary test match for Sri Lanka – in July 2022, against Pakistan. Before breaking into the senior national team in June 2022, he captained Sri Lanka at the 2022&nbsp;ICC (International Cricket Council) Under-19 Cricket World Cup. Sri Lanka finished the tournament in 6th place in a field of 16 teams. Dunith was one of the stars of the tournament, finishing as its highest wicket-taker (17 wickets) and 7th-highest run-scorer (264 runs). This incredible all-round performance saw him being included in the ‘Team of the Tournament’ by both ICC&nbsp;and ESPN Cricinfo (arguably the leading cricket portal in the world). In the Sri Lankan domestic circuit, he has played for Lankan Cricket Club (2019-Present), Colts Cricket Club, and Jaffna across all 3 formats. At the franchise level, he has turned out for Jaffna Kings (2022)&nbsp;in the LPL (Lanka Premier League). That season, he won the LPL title with the team – his debut season in the tournament.</p><h3>Born Name</h3><p>Dunith Nethmika Wellalage</p><h3>Nick Name</h3><p>Dunith</p><figure id=attachment_434992 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-434992 style=width:500px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Dunith Wellalage as seen in an Instagram Post in June 2020 (Dunith Wellalage / Instagram)</figure><h3>Sun Sign</h3><p>Capricorn</p><h3>Born Place</h3><p>Colombo, Western Province, Sri Lanka</p><h3>Residence</h3><p>Moratuwa, Colombo, Western Province, Sri Lanka</p><h3>Nationality</h3><p></p><h3>Education</h3><p>Dunith had attended <strong>St. Joseph’s College</strong>, a selective entry Catholic school in Colombo.</p><h3>Occupation</h3><p>Professional Cricketer</p><figure id=attachment_434993 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-434993 style=width:500px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Dunith Wellalage as seen in an Instagram Post in March 2022 (Dunith Wellalage / Instagram)</figure><h3>Family</h3><ul><li><strong>Father&nbsp;</strong>– Suranga Wellalage</li></ul><h3>Batting</h3><p>Left-Handed</p><h3>Bowling</h3><p>Slow Left-Arm Orthodox</p><h3>Role</h3><p>Bowler</p><h3>Jersey Number</h3><ul><li>1 – One Day International (ODI)</li><li>8 – Youth ODI</li></ul><h3>Build</h3><p>Athletic</p><h3>Height</h3><p>5 ft 8 in or 173 cm</p><h3>Weight</h3><p>69 kg or 152 lbs</p><figure id=attachment_434994 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-434994 style=width:500px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Dunith Wellalage as seen in an Instagram Post in November 2019 (Dunith Wellalage / Instagram)</figure><h3>Race / Ethnicity</h3><p>Asian</p><p>He is of Sri Lankan descent.</p><h3>Hair Color</h3><p>Black</p><h3>Eye Color</h3><p>Dark Brown</p><h3>Sexual Orientation</h3><p>Straight</p><h3>Distinctive Features</h3><ul><li>Toned physique</li><li>Short-cropped, side-parted hair</li><li>Affable smile</li><li>Often sports a thin mustache</li></ul><figure id=attachment_434991 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-434991 style=width:500px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Dunith Wellalage as seen in an Instagram Post in December 2022 (Dunith Wellalage / Instagram)</figure><h3>Dunith Wellalage Facts</h3><li>In Sri Lanka’s opening match of the group stage of the 2022 ICC&nbsp;Under-19 Cricket World Cup, against Scotland, Dunith recorded spectacular bowling figures of 5/27 to help Sri Lanka bundle out Scotland for 178 runs. Sri Lanka won the match by 40 runs and he was named the ‘Player of the match’ for his performance.</li><li>In the team’s next match, against 3-time champions Australia, he produced arguably the best all-round performance of the tournament. In the first half of the match, he produced his 2nd successive 5-wicket haul (5/28) to limit Australia to a below-par total of 175 runs. In the 2nd half of the match, he walked out to bat in the 8th over when his team was struggling a bit at 41/3.</li><li>Dunith played a captain’s knock (52 runs off 71 balls) and by the time he was the 6th wicket dismissed in the 37th over, Sri Lanka had already reached 171 runs, within touching distance of the target. For his outstanding display, he was named the ‘Player of the match’ for the 2nd game in succession.</li><li>In Sri Lanka’s next (and final) match of the group stage of the tournament, against the West Indies, Dunith produced the best bowling performance of the match, from either side, for the 3rd match in a row (3/39 this time). Sri Lanka went on to win the match by 3 wickets and advanced to the ‘super league’ (conducted for the 8 teams that finished in the ‘Top 2’ positions in the group stage) phase of the tournament.</li><li>In Sri Lanka’s next match of the tournament, a ‘super league’ quarter-final against Afghanistan, he produced his 2nd successive 3-wicket haul (3/36) that helped Sri Lanka restrict Afghanistan to a lowly total of 134 runs. In the 2nd half of the match, he walked out to bat with Sri Lanka tottering at 42/6 in the 17th over.</li><li>Dunith then rallied around with Sri Lanka’s lower-order batters to push the team’s score past the 100-run mark but was eventually dismissed for a score of 34 runs (the best by any player in his team) in the 41st over. Sri Lanka’s score was 112/8 at that time and despite further lower-order resistance, the team was dismissed for 130 runs, losing the match by a narrow margin of 4 runs.</li><li>In Sri Lanka’s next match of the tournament, a ‘super league’ playoff semi-final against South Africa, he starred with the bat. He scored his first hundred of the tournament (113 runs off 130 balls) and helped Sri Lanka reach a respectable total of 232 runs.</li><li>This made Dunith the first Sri Lankan captain to have scored a century in a match of the ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup. Sri Lanka went on to win the match by 65 runs and Dunith won the ‘Player of the match’ award for the 3rd time in the tournament.</li><li>In Sri Lanka’s last match of the tournament, a 5th-place playoff against Pakistan, he scored 40 runs in an otherwise dismal Sri Lankan batting performance that saw the team being dismissed for a paltry total of 127 runs, resulting in a humongous 238-run defeat.</li><p>Featured Image by Dunith Wellalage / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jp2sp6GknXq4sculmKWZl5p8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdunith-wellalage-height-weight-age-body-statistics.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdunith-wellalage-height-weight-age-body-statistics.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdunith-wellalage-height-weight-age-body-statistics.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdunith-wellalage-height-weight-age-body-statistics.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdunith-wellalage-height-weight-age-body-statistics.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdunith-wellalage-height-weight-age-body-statistics.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./gerard-butler-celebrity-profile-hollywood-life.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./gerard-butler-celebrity-profile-hollywood-life.html>Gerard Butler Celebrity Profile Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./blog.html>Blog</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./blog.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
