In full-team work, he watched a <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Lamar Jackson</a> pass sail right over his outstretched hand and land in the arms of tight end <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Mark Andrews</a>, who sprinted down the field and into the end zone. A combination of the heat and potentially a physical issue seemed to be bothering him as Hamilton called for a substitution after a few different plays.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Then, after his best play of Wednesday‚Äôs practice, a diving pass breakup on a Jackson pass intended for a streaking Likely, the rookie safety struggled to get up. Hamilton ultimately hobbled to the sideline and stayed there for several minutes, getting looked at by members of the athletic training staff. He did a series of stretches while on his back.</p><p>Hamilton, determined to stay on the field, jogged back to join the defense for a seven-on-seven session. However, he lasted just one play and pulled up while tracking <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Tylan Wallace</a> on a deep route. Wallace came over to check on Hamilton, who limped off the field. He stretched out his leg as if he was cramping and a few minutes later, he headed toward the training room, walking slowly up the hill and into the facility as members of the Ravens medical and athletic training staff trailed him.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ravens first round pick Kyle Hamilton walked to locker room gingerly with about 20 mins left in practice. Hamilton stayed down after making a diving pass breakup. He returned to field for one plat, pulled up and then headed inside with trainers.</p><p>‚Äî Jeff Zrebiec (@jeffzrebiec) <a href=#>August 3, 2022</a></p><p>The Ravens had their longest workout of training camp Wednesday, practicing for roughly 2 1/2 hours in over 90-degree temperatures. A number of players, including running back <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Nate McCrary</a>, wide receiver <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jaylon Moore</a> and cornerback <a class=ath_autolink href=#>David Vereen</a>, all hobbled off the field at different points and were given fluids by the team‚Äôs athletic training staff to combat the cramping.</p><p>It wasn‚Äôt clear whether Hamilton was also dealing with another physical issue. Ravens defensive coordinator Mike Macdonald declined to discuss Hamilton‚Äôs status, deferring the question to coach John Harbaugh, who wasn‚Äôt available to reporters. The 14th pick out of Notre Dame in April‚Äôs draft tweaked his ankle earlier in camp but has been playing through the injury. He walked off to the side of the field Monday, had his ankle retaped and quickly returned to practice.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Injury prevention has been a major focus for Harbaugh and his staff this summer after the team endured a litany of major injuries last season. The Ravens started training camp with a longer ramp-up period. They changed up their practice schedule and are mixing in ‚Äúexecution practices‚Äù to give the players a bit of a break. Wednesday was just their second time in pads this season, and several players struggled with the heat.</p><p>More observations from Wednesday:</p><p>‚Ä¢ Tight end <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Nick Boyle</a>, offensive linemen <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Kevin Zeitler</a>, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Morgan Moses</a> and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Patrick Mekari</a> and inside linebacker <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Patrick Queen</a> all returned to work after being sidelined Tuesday. The list of nonparticipants included wide receiver/returner <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Devin Duvernay</a> (thigh bruise), tight end <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Charlie Kolar</a> (hernia), defensive end <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Calais Campbell</a> (likely vet day), cornerback <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Brandon Stephens</a> and long snapper <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Nick Moore</a>. Ravens special teams coordinator Chris Horton said Moore had something he had to take care of and it‚Äôs anticipated he‚Äôll return to practice Thursday.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Jackson had a solid afternoon of work, taking several shots down the field while also mixing in some underneath stuff. As usual, he connected often with wide receiver <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Rashod Bateman</a> and Andrews. Jackson went 17-of-24 in full-team work with an interception by rookie <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Damarion Williams</a>. Jackson gave undrafted rookie <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Makai Polk</a> a chance to make a play on a deep shot, but he was surrounded by two defenders and Williams went up and got the ball. Jackson was 6-for-7 in seven-on-seven sessions.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Here at the Ravens we teach that 8 + 7 = 6 üñ©<a href=#>@Lj_era8</a> x <a href=#>@R_bateman2</a> | <a href=#>@oakley</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/U39xtRrxjU</a></p><p>‚Äî Baltimore Ravens (@Ravens) <a href=#>August 3, 2022</a></p><p>‚Ä¢ Adam Dedeaux, a quarterback guru who has been working with Jackson the past two offseasons, attended practice for the second straight day. Dedeaux primarily worked with Jackson on Wednesday, but also spent some time with backup <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Tyler Huntley</a> and communicated with offensive coordinator Greg Roman and quarterbacks coach James Urban throughout the workout. Dedeaux, who works with a number of <a class=ath_autolink href=#>NFL</a> quarterbacks, including <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Matthew Stafford</a>, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Dak Prescott</a> and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Matt Ryan</a>, has attended Ravens practices before. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very familiar and very comfortable with Adam Dedeaux,‚Äù Roman said. ‚ÄúWe spent a lot of time talking to him and pretty much explaining what we were wanting to get done and him giving us feedback on what he likes to do and kind of really getting a feel. And really, after talking to him initially, I was like, ‚ÄòMan, this guy is really sharp. He‚Äôs really good.‚Äô Lamar works with him in the offseason some, and then he‚Äôll come here and work with him, too. Anything we can do to help our cause, right? I think Adam is a real strength for us.‚Äù</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>‚Ä¢ Offseason safety acquisition Marcus Williams has been relatively quiet in camp, but he denied the offense a touchdown in the first full-team session by stepping in front of Wallace just outside the end zone and deflecting away a Jackson pass. Otherwise, the offense got the better of the defense in the session with Jackson hitting Bateman twice and Andrews once. On the Andrews touchdown, Ravens rookie center <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Tyler Linderbaum</a> and veteran left tackle Ja‚ÄôWuan James served as the lead blockers with Linderbaum putting safety <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Chuck Clark</a> on his back and James shoving cornerback <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Marlon Humphrey</a> several yards into the end zone. After the period, Macdonald urged his group to wake up.</p><p>‚Ä¢ The latest best-on-best matchup between Bateman and Humphrey in the one-on-ones was claimed by Bateman, who won with an inside move. Other highlights included <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Slade Bolden</a> easily getting free from <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jalyn Armour-Davis</a> in a matchup of Alabama rookies, Jaylon Moore getting the best of Denzel Williams with a diving deep catch of an <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Anthony Brown</a> throw and Armour-Davis blanketing Wallace. When the defense won the last rep, thanks to an overthrow of Devon Williams in the end zone, Ravens pass game specialist Keith Williams and Bateman did a round of pushups.</p><p>‚Ä¢ The defense started to hold its ground in the second full-team session as Williams intercepted Jackson and nose tackle <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Aaron Crawford</a> pushed Linderbaum back into Jackson, prompting the quarterback to throw the ball away. However, the highlight of the period was Jackson‚Äôs 80-yard touchdown to Andrews, who streaked down the middle of the field and sprinted to the end zone as safety <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Tony Jefferson</a> gave chase.</p><p>‚Ä¢ The third full-team session started with an errant Jackson throw and ended with six straight completions for the former league MVP who hit <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Justice Hill</a>, Bateman twice, Andrews, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Patrick Ricard</a> and Devon Williams.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Second-year wide receiver <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Binjimen Victor</a>, who is in the mix for the fifth receiver role, continues to build momentum. He made several catches Wednesday, elevating over <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Kyle Fuller</a> in one-on-ones, beating Armour-Davis in the back of the end zone in a full-team session and making a deep catch later while covered tightly by <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Kevon Seymour</a>.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Boyle had another drop, but Jackson went right back to the blocking tight end two plays later and Boyle secured the ball and rumbled into the end zone.</p><p>‚Ä¢ There was predictably a number of collisions with the pads back on. Ricard bounced off of Fuller, who stepped up to meet the fullback after a reception, and McCrary dropped linebacker <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jeremiah Moon</a> to the ground with a block. Fullback <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Ben Mason</a>, who loves when the pads go on, got into the act, driving defensive tackle <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Broderick Washington</a> a few yards out of a play. Humphrey slung James Proche out of bounds after the wide receiver made a reception.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>‚Ä¢ The offensive line was better than it was in Monday‚Äôs first padded practice. Still, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Justin Madubuike</a>, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Brent Urban</a>, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Odafe Oweh</a> and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Vince Biegel</a> all registered sacks. On Oweh‚Äôs sack, Jackson booted the ball across the field in frustration. About 45 minutes later, he did the same when the offense took a delay-of-game penalty.</p><p>‚Ä¢ <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Malik Harrison</a> did well to pursue a ball carrier and force him back inside, all while fending off a <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Tony Poljan</a> hold. Making matters worse for Poljan, his helmet flew off on the play.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Huntley and Proche connected for a long touchdown, but the most impressive aspect of the play was how hard undrafted rookie wide receiver <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Shemar Bridges</a> was working downfield to block for Proche. Several coaches and teammates waited for Bridges to return to the sideline to congratulate him on his effort to spring Proche.</p><p>‚Ä¢ It was only in warmups and he wasn‚Äôt being defended by anyone, but Devon Williams made one of the best catches of camp with a one-handed grab of a Brown deep throw.</p><p>‚Ä¢ With Nick Moore out of practice, former Ravens punter <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Sam Koch</a>, now working for the team as a special teams consultant, did some long snapping.</p><p>(Photo of Kyle Hamilton: Mitch Stringer / USA Today)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57km1ub2tjZ3xzfJFrZmlwX2WAcL7Ar5ynq12gxq2xjKGYpqGcqbyvecuapJqqXZ%2BupLfSqKVo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fravens-camp-rough-day-for-kyle-hamilton-lamar-jackson-rashod-bateman-on-point.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fravens-camp-rough-day-for-kyle-hamilton-lamar-jackson-rashod-bateman-on-point.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fravens-camp-rough-day-for-kyle-hamilton-lamar-jackson-rashod-bateman-on-point.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fravens-camp-rough-day-for-kyle-hamilton-lamar-jackson-rashod-bateman-on-point.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fravens-camp-rough-day-for-kyle-hamilton-lamar-jackson-rashod-bateman-on-point.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fravens-camp-rough-day-for-kyle-hamilton-lamar-jackson-rashod-bateman-on-point.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./robin-roberts-bio-wiki.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./robin-roberts-bio-wiki.html>Robin Roberts Bio (Wiki)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./nathan-dettmer-parents-wiki-biography-wife-age-height-net-worth.html>Nathan Dettmer Parents, Wiki, Biography, Wife, Age, Height, Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./nathan-dettmer-parents-wiki-biography-wife-age-height-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
