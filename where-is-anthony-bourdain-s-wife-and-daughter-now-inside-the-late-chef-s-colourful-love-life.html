We used a bunch of shots of his daughter when she was younger, but now that she’s a teenager, it just felt crossing the line to really do it.</p><h2>Ottavia And Ariane</h2><p>Bourdain and his second wife, Ottavia, welcomed daughter Ariane on April 9, 2007. Though he had previously said that he wouldn’t make a great parent, he put his utmost effort to be a good father to his daughter.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The celebrity chef described himself as a passive-aggressive yenta or Italian grandmother stereotype from films who is&nbsp;always urging people to eat. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He and Ariane bonded over food. He&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">called</a> Ariane a harsh critic who had a very acute palate.</p><p>After Bourdain’s passing in 2018, Ariane inherited the late TV personality’s estate.</p><h2>How Did He Die?</h2><p>Fans of Bourdain all over the world were disheartened when news of his passing came on June 8, 2018. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>He was working in France at the time and was found hanging&nbsp;in his hotel room by his longtime friend, chef Eric Ripert.</p><p>Though the cause of his death was concluded to be suicide, his girlfriend of that time, Asia Argento, received a lot of flak, as it was revealed that she had been dating another guy just a few days prior.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Argento <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">addressed</a> the cheating rumors during an interview with Daily Mail TV. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>People say I murdered Anthony Bourdain. I cheated on him… but he cheated on me, too. It wasn’t a problem for us. But I understand that the world needs to find a reason. I would like to find a reason too. I don’t have it.</p><p>Argento also explained that Bourdain traveled for a greater portion of the year every year and it had put a strain on their relationship, just like it had on his previous two marriages.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmeqbWwuthmmaitopmuqrqMsKCfnV2Zrrazx62cq2aYqbqt</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhere-is-anthony-bourdain-s-wife-and-daughter-now-inside-the-late-chef-s-colourful-love-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhere-is-anthony-bourdain-s-wife-and-daughter-now-inside-the-late-chef-s-colourful-love-life.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhere-is-anthony-bourdain-s-wife-and-daughter-now-inside-the-late-chef-s-colourful-love-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhere-is-anthony-bourdain-s-wife-and-daughter-now-inside-the-late-chef-s-colourful-love-life.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhere-is-anthony-bourdain-s-wife-and-daughter-now-inside-the-late-chef-s-colourful-love-life.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-is-anthony-bourdain-s-wife-and-daughter-now-inside-the-late-chef-s-colourful-love-life.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bafta-nominee-bukky-bakray-was-first-picked-for-rocks-through-her-school-s-performing-art-cl.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bafta-nominee-bukky-bakray-was-first-picked-for-rocks-through-her-school-s-performing-art-cl.html>BAFTA Nominee Bukky Bakray Was First Picked for Rocks through Her Schools Performing Art Cl</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-mike-tyson-s-daughter-inside-the-tragic-loss-of-his-fifth-child.html>What Happened to Mike Tysons Daughter?
