The lyrics explore the themes of heartbreak and loneliness as the singer tries to come to terms with the end of a relationship. The opening lines of the song set the tone for the rest of it: "Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom, well who am I to keep you down?" The singer accepts that the relationship is over and that the other person wants their freedom, but she also acknowledges the pain she feels in her loneliness. The line "It's only right that you should play the way you feel it" suggests that the other person should be true to themselves, but it also implies a sense of resignation that the singer must accept their decision regardless of how it makes her feel.</p><br><p>The chorus of the song, with the line "Thunder only happens when it's raining", is the most iconic part of the song. This line is a metaphor for the turmoil that accompanies a breakup. The next line, "Players only love you when they're playing", suggests that those who claim to love you may not be sincere, and they only love you when they are getting something out of it. The final line, "Say women, they will come and they will go, when the rain washes you clean, you'll know", is an acknowledgement that relationships are temporary and that one must be willing to accept the heartbreak that comes with them.</p><br><p>Overall, "Dreams" is an incredibly powerful song that resonates with people of all ages and backgrounds. It explores the universal themes of love, loss, and heartbreak in a way that is both captivating and heart-wrenching.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line
