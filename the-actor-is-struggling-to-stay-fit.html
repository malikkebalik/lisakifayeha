The Captain Jack Sparrow actor filed a lawsuit against his ex-wife, Amber Heard, and the defamation trial is ongoing. After the divorce, Johnny has supposedly gained some weight and fans are eager to know about Johnnyâ€™s weight gain journey in detail.</strong></p><p><strong>John Christopher Depp II </strong>is an <strong><a href=#>actor</a></strong>, producer, and musician from Owensboro, Kentucky who has a huge fan following around the world and is best known as Captain Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp began his career as a member of the rock band <strong>The Kids</strong> before deciding to pursue acting.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Johnny Depp</a></strong>'s captivating performance as Edward Scissorhands in Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands cemented his image as one of Hollywood's most in-demand actors, garnering him his first Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Motion Picture. Among his various film attempts, Depp had worked on eight films with filmmaker and friend <strong>Tim Burton</strong>.</p><p>Recently, Johnny Depp has been into legal actions against his ex-wife, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Amber Heard</a></strong>, and fans have been curious to know more about him, including his weight gain journey.</p><p>Previously, we touched on the <strong><a href=#>weight gain</a></strong> stories of <strong><a href=#>Brianna Keilar</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Jessica Simpson</a></strong>.</p><h2><strong>Johnny Depp's Weight Gain in 2022</strong></h2><p>According to the National Enquirer, <strong>Johnny Depp</strong> is looking a little worse for wear. While Depp prepares to go to court in his defamation lawsuit against ex-wife, <strong>Amber Heard</strong>, fans are concerned that the actor's recent weight gain may be causing health issues.</p><p>Since his divorce in 2019, Johnny Depp (<a href=# rel=noopener>@johnnydepp </a>) has gained noticeable weight.&nbsp;At 260 pounds, the actor is reportedly busting the scales, and his court battle with Heard has only made matters worse.</p><p>As most expected, stress and an overeating habit are likely to be the causes of Johnny's weight gain. Many people believe Johnny has been struggling with mental health concerns, and the rumors are true because Johnny admitted to having a mental health condition in court. As a result, it's possible that Johnny is gaining weight as a side effect.</p><p>There have been speculations since 2016 that a remake of The Invisible Man is in development, with Johnny Depp supposed to play Griffin. Many of Johnny's admirers have reacted positively to the news that he has divorced Amber, while others have praised him for his new appearance.</p><p>Johnny was referred to as an old fat man by his sister, which Johnny Depp appears to take seriously. According to fans, Johnny's lack of self-care may be to blame for his stress and overeating.</p><p>However, we must acknowledge that Johnny now appears to be younger than before, thanks to his concerns for his health. We hope he never has to cope with his former problem because he now appears to be in better shape and health.</p><p>That pasty face isn't entirely made up. Johnny Depp appears to be blotched, fat, and puffy in recent images. He also didn't have to wear a fat suit in the Minamata movie. Everyone's favorite Captain Jack Sparrow appears to have gained around 80-100 pounds.</p><p>Meanwhile, many sources claim that he is good and healthy, with one noting that Johnny is healthy and enjoying his time on the road with his band,<strong> Hollywood Vampires</strong>.</p><h2>Here is Why Amber Heard Might Be Playing Mind Games with Johnny Depp</h2><p>With each passing day, additional evidence emerges that <strong>Amber Heard</strong>'s obsession with <strong>Johnny Depp</strong> is abnormal. She deliberately intended to develop a career in movies from the moment she met Depp on the set of the Rum Diaries movie audition, but she was always driven by her fascination with him.</p><p>When the two of them got into physically violent altercations, everything went to hell, yet evidence in this trial kept pointing to Heard as the main villain of the story. Her legal team tried four times to sabotage the trial, and she consistently refused to produce evidence requested by Depp's legal team.</p><p>Heard is now playing mind games with Johnny, maybe revealing her psychopathic tendencies, because she didn't get what she wanted.</p><p>Johnny Depp <a href=# rel=noopener>wore</a> an all-black shirt with a black tie and a fully gray suit in one of his last public appearances before the trial. On the first day of the trial, Amber Heard <a href=# rel=noopener>sported</a> the same dress. Depp wore a black Gucci bee tie on the same day, and Amber Heard wore the same tie the next day.</p><p>On that day, Johnny dressed all black, and on the third day of the trial, Heard wore all black. She's clearly leaving the trial and going to buy the exact same dress she wore, but why is that? We inspect that she might be playing mind games with him.</p><p><strong>Visit <a href=#>House & Whips</a> for more <a href=#>interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGihqKCeo8ZusMSpp2avlZ60qcCMoJiipl8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-actor-is-struggling-to-stay-fit.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-actor-is-struggling-to-stay-fit.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-actor-is-struggling-to-stay-fit.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-actor-is-struggling-to-stay-fit.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-actor-is-struggling-to-stay-fit.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-actor-is-struggling-to-stay-fit.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-is-easy-to-lift-but-hard-to-throw-riddle.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-is-easy-to-lift-but-hard-to-throw-riddle.html>What is Easy to Lift But Hard to Throw?
