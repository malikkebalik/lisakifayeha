He was the funniest Monkee, their Ringo, their truest hippie, always happy to pitch in with a banjo solo or a bit of his dazed flower-child wisdom. This man knew how to rock a black-velvet silver-button tunic. That’s why fans around the world are grieving&nbsp;his death Thursday&nbsp;at 77. As he promised all those years ago in “For Pete’s Sake,” he made the world shine.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-919 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span><p><strong>Source:www.rollingstone.com</strong></p><h3>Hear a Celebration of Peter Tork’s Life and Music</h3><p>The latest episode of our Rolling Stone Music Now podcast celebrates the life and music of Peter Tork, with previously unheard interview audio and more.

That’s almost exactly what the Byrds and the Beach Boys did, and the Byrds, after all, were playing other people’s songs with other musicians in the studio.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_16"></span><p>Download and subscribe to Rolling Stone Music Now, hosted by Brian Hiatt, on iTunes or Spotify, and check out two years worth of episodes in the archive, including in-depth interviews with Bruce Springsteen, Ice Cube, Neil Young, the National, Julian Casablancas, Sheryl Crow, Johnny Marr, Fleetwood Mac, Donald Fagen, Phil Collins, Alicia Keys, Kelly Clarkson, Pete Townshend, Bob Seger, Gary Clark Jr. and many more – plus dozens of episodes featuring genre-spanning discussions and debates.

We want those fans to know with absolute certainty that your spirit and goodwill fed Peter with continued energy and force (and of course humor).”</p><p>The family asked fans to make a donation to The Institute for The Musical Arts in Massachusetts in Tork’s name.

I have said this before — and now it seems even more apt — the reason we called it a band is because it was where we all went to play,” Nesmith shared on Facebook. “A band no more — and yet the music plays on — an anthem to all who made the Monkees and the TV show our private — dare I say ‘secret’ — playground. As for Pete, I can only pray his songs to reach the heights that can lift us and that our childhood lives forever — that special sparkle that was the Monkees. I will miss him — a brother in arms.
