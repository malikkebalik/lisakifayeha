Ken Griffey Sr., his baseball-playing father, accompanied him on his first flight. His father had already taken him up and let him fly a few times when he was 13-14 years old. In an interview, he stated that when he received his first single parcel of land, he first called his wife’s name, followed by his father’s.</p><p>He claimed that there was no danger of an aircraft disaster because learning about the Cirrus plane was straightforward for him and it contained a safety component such as a parachute. Ken recently purchased an auto-landing Cirrus Vision Jet. He said that by pressing a button, it would make contact with the tower, determine the winds, land at the airport, and come to a stop on the runway, allowing you to open the door.</p><h2><span id=Only_baseball_got_Kens_left_hand>Only baseball got Ken’s left hand</span></h2><p>Ken revealed that he is right-handed in an interview with The Pivot Podcast. He uses his right hand to write, his right foot to kick, his right hand to eat, and his right hand to play tennis.

As a player, he used to earn an average of $3.5 million a year.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
