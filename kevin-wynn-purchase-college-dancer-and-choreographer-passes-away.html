A profound artist, choreographer, and educator, Wynn‚Äôs impact on the dance community was immeasurable. He was not just an Associate Professor Emeritus of Dance but also a cherished mentor, inspiring countless individuals with his brilliance and passion.</p><p>Born and raised in Washington, D.C., Wynn‚Äôs journey in dance began with prestigious training at the Duke Ellington School of the Arts and Workshops for Careers in the Arts. His thirst for knowledge led him to further his education at Cal Arts and the Conservatory of Dance at Purchase College, where he honed his craft and artistic vision.</p><p>Wynn‚Äôs career was marked by collaborations with renowned dance companies and choreographers, including the Jos√© Lim√≥n Dance Company, Dianne McIntyre‚Äôs Sounds in Motion Dance Company, and Jacques d‚ÄôAmboise, among others. His choreographic brilliance graced prestigious stages such as the Joyce Theater, Lincoln Center Out-of-Doors, and Symphony Space in New York City.</p><p>His artistic endeavors extended globally, with commissions from esteemed international organizations, including Ailey II, Singapore Dance Ensemble, and American Ballet Theater Intensive. Wynn‚Äôs dedication to dance education was unparalleled; he conducted workshops and served as a choreographer at prestigious institutions like the Tisch School of the Arts, Yale University, and UCLA.</p><p>Wynn‚Äôs contributions to the arts were acknowledged through numerous accolades and grants, including recognition from the National Endowment for the Arts, the New York State Council on the Arts, and the Harkness Foundation. His exceptional dedication to D.R.A. (Dancers Responding to AIDS) earned him a distinguished award of appreciation.</p><p>In the academic realm, Wynn held the position of a part-time, tenured associate professor at the Conservatory of Dance at Purchase College and contributed significantly to the Alvin Ailey/Fordham University BFA program. His impact was not limited to the classroom; he engaged in residencies across various countries, solidifying his international reputation in dance and choreography.</p><p>The dance community, as well as those who had the privilege of knowing him, mourn the loss of Kevin Wynn. His legacy as a visionary artist, inspiring teacher, and compassionate mentor will forever resonate, continuing to influence generations of dancers and artists to come.</p><p>Nattie Trogdon&nbsp; shared a post&nbsp; on fb on the death of Kevin:</p><p>I‚Äôve written and deleted this post so many times as I don‚Äôt have the full words to encapsulate the spirit of this magnificent human ‚Äì Kevin Wynn. My beloved teacher ‚Äì an absolute force ‚Äì a resilient spirit ‚Äì a bighearted generous choreographer/dancer/friend.<br>He would sit in the lounge at Purchase after class and talk to us about life and love and his experiences as a dancer and choreographer. He‚Äôd give us advice on where we should go and what artists we should look into -he loved us so deeply and cared about our futures as artists and people. He was cheeky and sly and at times relentless in his push for us to be better dancers. I‚Äôll never forget him lovingly yelling at me in class ‚ÄúNat ‚Äì get your shit together‚Äù when I was checked out and wasn‚Äôt present and wasn‚Äôt giving it all to one of his absolutely mind-boggling combos. (If you know, you know) No one could make me get my shit together like Kev could.<br>I loved him so dearly and every time I‚Äôd return to Purchase to sub a class or teach for a semester I‚Äôd stop by and see him if only for a brief moment. I‚Äôll never forget how his eyes would light up and he‚Äôd give me the most massive full body hug ‚Äúhey girl how you doin? You good? How‚Äôs your boo? He still dancing for that Doug guy? You dancing? Making work. Good. Keep it up‚Äù<br>Kevin ‚Äì you beautiful complex wonderful kind big hearted human. I‚Äôll love you forever and ever. And I know I‚Äôm in a vast sea of people who love you so dearly and are mourning your loss right now. I wish you could‚Äôve seen what we‚Äôre making at Purchase this semester and I wish I could‚Äôve been enveloped by one of your full body hugs one more time. I think about you always ‚Äì how you held space and cared for your students. How you weren‚Äôt afraid to be vulnerable and complex and show your humanity. I‚Äôll throw some ‚Äúmonkey ears‚Äù into our work for you and know I‚Äôve gotten my shit together and it‚Äôs a big thanks to the lessons you taught me a decade ago (even if it took some time for them to sink in)<br>Rest in Peace Kevin Wynn. Thank you for everything. Holding all who loved him and shared the space with him in my heart today. üíî</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51kuKbCyKdksLGeo3qxwdGcn5qrlWKwsLjLnp6eZZSWu6Sx0WaYp5xdmLWwvsSonquZoJ2ys3nPmqqsnaNirrit2Gg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkevin-wynn-purchase-college-dancer-and-choreographer-passes-away.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkevin-wynn-purchase-college-dancer-and-choreographer-passes-away.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkevin-wynn-purchase-college-dancer-and-choreographer-passes-away.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkevin-wynn-purchase-college-dancer-and-choreographer-passes-away.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkevin-wynn-purchase-college-dancer-and-choreographer-passes-away.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkevin-wynn-purchase-college-dancer-and-choreographer-passes-away.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./rupaul-net-worth-kahawatungu.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./rupaul-net-worth-kahawatungu.html>RuPaul Net Worth - KahawaTungu</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kesha-nichols-husband-basketball-wives-age-richard-jefferson-bio-tami-roman.html>Kesha Nichols Husband Basketball Wives Age Richard Jefferson Bio Tami Roman</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kesha-nichols-husband-basketball-wives-age-richard-jefferson-bio-tami-roman.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
