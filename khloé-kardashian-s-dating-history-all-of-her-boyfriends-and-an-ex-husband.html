Their relationship was short-lived, however, after she claimed he cheated on her during an episode of her reality series at the time, “Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami.”</p><p>McCants later <a href=#>claimed to Page Six</a> that she had “made the whole thing up” for a storyline on the show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Derrick Ward</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Derrick Ward and Kardashian dated in 2009. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>In April 2009, Kardashian cozied up to former NFL player Derrick Ward at her sister Kourtney Kardashian’s 30th birthday party in Mexico.

The reality star filed for divorce again in May 2016 and it was finalized in December that same year.</p><p>The athlete has made it clear that he is not over the reality star, stating publicly in 2022 that he wants to <a href=#>reconnect with her</a> and even <a href=#>referred to her as his “wife”</a> in an Instagram post in March.</p><p>“I would just probably want to take her to dinner. It will be a blessing just to be in her presence. Just to tell her I’m sorry and what a fool I was,” he said in February 2022 on “Celebrity Big Brother.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Matt Kemp</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Matt Kemp and Kardashian were seen together multiple times in 2013. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>After she initially filed divorce from Odom in 2013, Kardashian and baseball player Matt Kemp were spotted at several concerts together including Jay-Z, Drake and John Legend.</p><p>However, a source at the time <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">insisted to People</a> that the pair were just friends.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>French Montana</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Kardashian dated rapper French Montana in 2014. <span class=credit>WireImage</span></figure><p>Kardashian went on to date rapper French Montana for a little under a year in 2014.</p><p>In December 2014, she said during an episode of “Kourtney and Khloé take the Hamptons” that she <a href=#>rushed into a relationship with Montana </a>when she wasn’t ready.</p><p>“I was just, like, lonely and destructive.

It was reported at the time that their relationship was strained because of Odom’s overdose, but Khloé claimed on an episode of her now-defunct talk show that Harden <a href=#>had cheated on her</a>.</p><p>“I don’t want to put up with people — you want to be monogamous but then you’re not monogamous,” she said. “I’ve always said it’s long distance … we don’t need to be monogamous. There’s a lot of s–t going on in both of our lives. You live in Houston. I live in L.A. Let’s see each other, when we see each other.”</p><p>He <a href=#>told Sports Illustrated</a> at the time that it was the “worst year” of his life.</p><p>“I didn’t like all the attention,” <a href=#>he said</a>. “I feel like it was for no reason. I wasn’t getting anything out of it except my name out there and my face out there, and I don’t need that.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Trey Songz</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Kardashian hung out with Trey Songz during the summer of 2016. <span class=credit>WireImage</span></figure><p>Kardashian <a href=#>moved on with rapper Trey Songz</a> in July 2016.

Chyna ain’t married yet,” he said, claiming the third was Rob Kardashian’s now-ex-fiancée Blac Chyna. “It’s all good, you know what I’m saying? It’s facts.”</p><p>It’s unclear if he had any romantic involvement with Kardashian, but online reports linked them right after her split from Odom in 2013.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tristan Thompson</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Kardashian dated Tristan Thompson from 2016 until 2021, although there were plenty of breaks in the middle. <span class=credit>Getty Images for Klutch Sports G</span></figure><p>Kardashian and Tristan Thompson were set up on a blind date by the reality star’s friend Brandon Jennings in 2016. News broke in September 2017 that the couple <a href=#>were expecting their first child</a> together, <a href=#>confirming the news</a> in December of that year.</p><p>However, the couple hit their first big bump in the road just days before Kardashian <a href=#>welcomed their daughter True</a> in April 2018. While the reality star was in Cleveland — where the NBA player was playing at the time — waiting to give birth, it was revealed Tristan <a href=#>spent the night with model Lani Blair</a> in NYC.</p><p>Although she decided to forgive him, the couple called it quits in February 2019 when news broke that Thompson and Kylie Jenners’ pal Jordyn Woods <a href=#>couldn’t “keep their hands off each other” at a party</a>.</p><p>They <a href=#>rekindled their romance</a> in June 2020 while spending time together during the COVID-19 pandemic, but <a href=#>split once again in June 2021</a> after model Sydney Chase alleged she’d hooked up with Thompson in the fall of 2020.</p><p>It was revealed in Season 1 of Hulu’s “The Kardashians” that Kardashian <a href=#>had secretly given Thompson yet another chance</a> in October 2021.</p><p>“We’re good. We’re actually in a really good place. We just got back together. He’s been going to therapy a lot. There’s just been a lot of effort on his part,” she said on the show, just months before it would be revealed he fathered a child with another woman.</p><p>In December 2021, Maralee Nichols <a href=#>filed a paternity suit against Thompson</a>, who copped to sleeping with her on his 30th birthday in March 2021 while still dating Kardashian. The following month he <a href=#>admitted to fathering Nichols’ son Theo</a> and publicly apologized to Kardashian.</p><p>“Khloé, you don’t deserve this. You don’t deserve the heartache and humiliation I have caused you,” he wrote on social media. “You don’t deserve the way I have treated you over the years.”</p><p>In the Season 1 finale of “The Kardashians,” the Good American co-founder broke down in tears <a href=#>learning about the infidelity from Kim Kardashian</a>.</p><p>“I feel not really in my own body, like these things are just happening, and I’m just going through the motions,” <a href=#>she said</a>, “but when things happen to you a couple times you do kind of become immune to them, which is really sad.”</p><p>As of now, it seems these two are finally done for good.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiokZyytLXXZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKOYobymecqaqZ2Zo522orqMnZitoZ6ceqm10q2mq7Fdl7y6stGinKeco2KyuXnHrqqbmZ6ZfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkhlo%25C3%25A9-kardashian-s-dating-history-all-of-her-boyfriends-and-an-ex-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkhlo%25C3%25A9-kardashian-s-dating-history-all-of-her-boyfriends-and-an-ex-husband.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkhlo%25C3%25A9-kardashian-s-dating-history-all-of-her-boyfriends-and-an-ex-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkhlo%25C3%25A9-kardashian-s-dating-history-all-of-her-boyfriends-and-an-ex-husband.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkhlo%25C3%25A9-kardashian-s-dating-history-all-of-her-boyfriends-and-an-ex-husband.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkhlo%25C3%25A9-kardashian-s-dating-history-all-of-her-boyfriends-and-an-ex-husband.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./maine-mendoza-wiki-what-s-her-ethnicity-religion-and-origin.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./maine-mendoza-wiki-what-s-her-ethnicity-religion-and-origin.html>Maine Mendoza Wiki: Whats Her Ethnicity?
