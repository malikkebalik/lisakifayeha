Then he was making regular child support payments, but they dropped off after he relocated to the East Coast, according to ex-wife Bethany Richardson.</p><p>“The payments started to become sporadic, $500 here, a few months would go by, then he’d send $1,000. Then a whole year would go by, and there would be nothing,” Richardson alleged to The Post.</p><p>“I just want him exposed for the fraud that he is, the liar that he is, and [so] that the people who really know him, know he’s a fake,” his ex added.</p><span class=screen-reader-text>Previous</span><p><span>1</span> of <span>3</span></p><span class=screen-reader-text>Next</span><p class="ad__label ad__label--top">Advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/nyc-luxury-desinger-child-support-arrest-04.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/nyc-luxury-desinger-child-support-arrest-08.jpg><p><span class=screen-reader-text>Advertisement</span></p><p>She said she had attempted to take Castleberry to court in 2012 over missed payments, but he missed every hearing. Lawyers told her nothing could be done because he didn’t live in the state.</p><p>While Castleberry was galavanting around New York, Richardson was a struggling single mom living with her mother and their two sons. Later, she made enough money to live in her own apartment, but not enough for furniture. Her boys shared a bedroom and slept on a pallet on the floor in Weatherford, Texas.</p><p>“I did whatever I had to freaking do to provide for those kids,” Richardson recalled. “I came up with $25 — just to have enough gas to get us to payday.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Castleberry’s ex-wife said their children slept on pallets on the floor, as the single mom struggled to make ends meet during years of unpaid or sporadic child support. <span class=credit>Courtesy Bethany Richardson</span></figure><p>When their youngest son turned 18 last year, Richardson said the Texas Attorney General’s Office, which handles child support, contacted her to close the file but quickly realized Castleberry still had an outstanding balance of $240,000 and started a lawsuit to help her collect the money.</p><p>Castleberry turned down The Post’s offer to be interviewed, but sent a statement saying: “I wish I could share that information with you; however, doing so would violate the privacy of my family and friends who have been a great support during this difficult time.”</p><p>Another court date was set up to figure out how much money was owned, but Castleberry didn’t attend. A frustrated Texas judge then took the move to issue an arrest warrant for the impeccably dressed designer. A lawyer representing Richardson, Lacy Kimbell, told The Post they calculated he owed nearly $390,000 — after unpaid medical bills for the children, attorney’s fee and interest were added.</p><p>The judge ordered Castleberry be arrested the next time he set foot in Texas.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Unable to pay for his own bond, Castleberry’s family set up a GoFundMe account with the headline, “Free Frederick.” <span class=credit>GoFundMe</span></figure><p>He was then brought in by authorities on Oct. 28 at his father’s home and spent more than a month in jail. As Castleberry didn’t have enough for bail, his family launched a GoFundMe page begging for donations to help secure his release.</p><p>In the end, those donations were used to pay his ex-wife a lump sum of $50,000 so she would agree for his release from jail. The father of two, whose kids are now legal adults, is now on a payment program and probation for nine years while he pays off the obligation to his children.</p><p>A review of Castleberry’s public records show he owes a lot of people money. There are multiple tax liens and judgements against him including: $2,619 for Barclay’s Bank; $3,118 owed to George Malafis; two IRS liens for $6,104 and $35,685 and two liens for taxes owned in New York State for $6,021 and $3,118.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Castleberry’s ex-wife, Bethany Richardson, is now remarried and living in Weatherford, Texas. <span class=credit>Courtesy Bethany Richardson</span></figure><p>The designer’s father, John David Castleberry, has also served time. Federal prosecutors <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">convicted the elder Castleberry</a> of filing and preparing fraudulent tax returns in 2015 and sentenced him to 126 months in federal prison and $328,143.90 in restitution to the IRS.</p><p>“As a result of the fraudulently-overstated income tax withholding, the tax returns that were filed on behalf of the defendants and/or their clients claimed large refunds to which the defendants and their clients were not entitled,” the US Attorney’s Office said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3N7kGtmaXFfo8akecuur66qqWKxpr%2FIoKWeql2bv6awjJyYrKycmq%2BmvtGyZKOZmaGypXnOr5yrZZOdtq2wjKysqaifp8Fw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnyc-luxury-designer-fred-castleberry-jailed-in-child-support-dispute.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnyc-luxury-designer-fred-castleberry-jailed-in-child-support-dispute.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnyc-luxury-designer-fred-castleberry-jailed-in-child-support-dispute.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnyc-luxury-designer-fred-castleberry-jailed-in-child-support-dispute.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnyc-luxury-designer-fred-castleberry-jailed-in-child-support-dispute.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnyc-luxury-designer-fred-castleberry-jailed-in-child-support-dispute.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./rockmond-dunbar.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./rockmond-dunbar.html>Rockmond Dunbar</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./london-king.html>London King</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./london-king.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
