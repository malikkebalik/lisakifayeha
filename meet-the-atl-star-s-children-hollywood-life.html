They really do enjoy each other. They really are friends first, which is what develops into love,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>InStyle </a>in Jan. 2023.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Speaking of love, the California native hasn’t had it easy. She <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>lost her partner</a> and father to her youngest child,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nipsey Hussle</strong></a> (née Ermias Joseph Asghedom), in 2019. Before that, she welcomed her first child with rapper&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lil Wayne</strong></a>, which she admitted was a scary experience. “I had my first son when I was 24, and I was really afraid. I didn’t think that I was going to do good, and I wasn’t prepared,” she recalled. “I didn’t know what was going to happen or what I was going to do.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Lauren and Lil Wayne’s son, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kameron Carter</strong></a> is now 13, and Lauren and Nipsey’s son, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kross Asghedom</strong></a>, is 6 years old.&nbsp;The music video star, model, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>actress</a> likes to keep things pretty low-key with her family, only posting about her boys to her social media on occasion, but when she does, fans can’t get enough of their sweet faces — and how much they resemble their dads! Read more below about Lauren’s charming brood and see pictures of them below!</p><h2>Kameron</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/lauren-london-kids-SS-embed-21.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kameron</a>, born on September 9, 2009, is Lauren’s eldest son she shares with Lil Wayne, 40. Although the actress doesn’t speak often about her former on-again-off-again relationship with the rapper, she did dish to Skin Deep&nbsp;author <strong>Kathleen Cross</strong> about how she and Lil Wayne met when she was 15. “We were in a relationship that didn’t make it. We tried more than once to revive it, and we were engaged briefly years ago, but we eventually parted ways,” Lauren revealed, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Essence</a>. “My son’s father is an intelligent, loving, and lovable person who will always be a dear friend. That is all.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Lauren added that she and the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>other women</a> with whom Lil Wayne shares children have managed to stay friendly, opting for peace over drama.&nbsp;“We are all good-hearted women who love our children and we want them to know each other,” she shared. “Real friendships have grown from that foundation, and the result has been more love, less drama, and less trauma for our kids.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Having “less trauma” for her kids is definitely front-of-mind for Lauren, especially because they are both Black children. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jada Pinkett Smith </strong></a>asked the mother-of-two about “raising two Black boys” during a 2020 episode of Red Table Talk, wondering what some of her “precautions” may be with the ongoing state of the world as it struggles with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>racial discrimination and police brutality</a> in mind. “What I instill in them is more about the police. How to handle yourself<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> when you get pulled over</a>,” Lauren responded. “That’s more of my education, protecting them being Black men in America.”</p><h2>Kross</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/lauren-london-kids-SS-embed-11.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>Kross is Lauren’s son she shares with the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>late Nipsey Hussle</a>, who was shot and killed on March 31, 2019 at the age of 33 in front of his Marathon clothing store in Los Angeles, California. Kross was born on August 31, 2016, and Lauren continues to post adorable photos of the youngster — who so perfectly resembles his mother and father — to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> account.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“<span>Kross The Boss!” Lauren <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>captioned a post</a> of the 5-year-old on his birthday in August, as seen below. The mom also called her son her “lighthouse” and “strength,” signing off the caption by calling him “BabyHussle.”<br></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Although Lauren <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>continues to grieve</a> her late love, she still looks forward to caring for both Kross and Kameron in the best way she can, leading her boys toward a purposeful, optimistic life. “We can’t stop, you know? We do have a purpose, all of us, and it’s important for my sons to see me moving forward with grief, not just curling up in a ball, because I curled up in a ball for a long time,” Lauren told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight </a>in April. “But especially for my eldest son because he’s just a little more aware […] but we will continue moving on as we had to, as he would want us to.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>During her 2023 chat with InStyle, she gushed about raising her boys. “It has been the greatest joy of my life, being the mother of these two beautiful children,” she said. “And I did not know that it was going to be so magical. My biggest blessing are my kids.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8uarKudnmK5sLrDqKVmo5mZwG6AlGxpaWpgZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-the-atl-star-s-children-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmeet-the-atl-star-s-children-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmeet-the-atl-star-s-children-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmeet-the-atl-star-s-children-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-the-atl-star-s-children-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-the-atl-star-s-children-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./phyllis-smith.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./phyllis-smith.html>Phyllis Smith</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./katie-mchugh-marriage-husband-kids-affairs-lifestyle-net-worth.html>Katie McHugh Marriage, Husband, Kids, Affairs, Lifestyle &amp;amp; Net worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./katie-mchugh-marriage-husband-kids-affairs-lifestyle-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
