However,&nbsp;it’s been a while since he was banned from the platform.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>He has recently announced&nbsp;he&nbsp;will be&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">suing the live-streaming platform</a> for their ban on him. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Doc has no doubt had a&nbsp;rough year due to the ban. But he has always had his wife,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mrs. Assassin</a>, as she goes on Instagram, by his side through the good and bad. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Unfaithfulness, Reconciliation, And Bad Fortune</h2><p>Mrs. Assassin has had to endure a lot during her time with Dr. Disrespect. Life with Dr. Disrespect, real name Herschel “Guy” Beahm IV, is not easy with all the attention he gets and the mess he makes.</p><p>The couple <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reportedly got married</a> in 2013, and since then, they have had a couple of hiccups in their marriage. The first, and the most serious one, came in 2017. During a stream in December that year, he <a href=# rel=follow>admitted to cheating</a>.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In his confession, he teared up and acknowledged his “stupid (expletive) mistakes.” Then, he said he was taking a break from streaming, saying, "I'm going to take time off to focus on my family, and I just wanted to let you guys know that." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Further, he extended apologies to Twitch, his followers, and sponsors.&nbsp;But he returned. And he came back with his family, seemingly stronger than before. From that moment, his wife started appearing on more of his streams and videos.</p><p>Usually, she appears as a hand that feeds him during the streams, adding a light, comedic touch to his usually stressful streams. However, less than a year after things got back to normal, disaster struck again for the couple.</p><p>The couple who is parents to daughter Alana couldn't expand their&nbsp;family of three to become&nbsp;four when&nbsp;Mrs. Assassin suffered a&nbsp;miscarriage in 2018. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Dr. Disrespect <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">announced the loss</a> of what would have been his son during a Twitch stream on June 13, 2018.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Handling Controversies and Bans</h2><p>Dr. Disrespect is a character Beahm plays online. And with that comes the responsibility of keeping everyone entertained. However, during that process, he has sometimes crossed the line and been labeled as&nbsp;toxic and offensive.</p><p>One of those came in 2018 when he was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">accused of being racist</a>. Jimmy Wong, a musician, called him out for his disrespectful caricatures of Chinese accents and language. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Dr. Disrespect responded to the accusation by pointing to his wife’s ethnicity — she is multiracial, hailing from the small island of Molokai — noting&nbsp;that he had a lot of multiethnic, multiracial friends, and calling Wong’s callout “laughable.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Then came&nbsp;his feuds with Twitch. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Per Variety</a>, the first, smaller ban came in June 2019 when he violated Twitch’s privacy rules and California’s Penal Code.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The bigger one came in June 2020 when Twitch <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">permanently banned</a> Dr. Disrespect from the platform, with reasons still unknown. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Mrs. Assassin has been supporting her husband through all these. She came out thanking fans for their support after the ban took effect.</p><p>With Dr. Disrespect’s lawsuit set to make headlines soon, the outcome will be interesting. But even more interesting, or rather heartwarming, will be seeing Mrs. Assassin by his side.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJyiYrGqv9Geqqmdk6l6uLXFnmSdmaWctbWx0WefraWc</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdr-disrespect-s-wife-has-been-with-him-through-thick-and-thin.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdr-disrespect-s-wife-has-been-with-him-through-thick-and-thin.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdr-disrespect-s-wife-has-been-with-him-through-thick-and-thin.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdr-disrespect-s-wife-has-been-with-him-through-thick-and-thin.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdr-disrespect-s-wife-has-been-with-him-through-thick-and-thin.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdr-disrespect-s-wife-has-been-with-him-through-thick-and-thin.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./hall-of-fame-patriots-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./hall-of-fame-patriots-net-worth.html>Hall of Fame, Patriots &amp;amp; Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./carla-alapont-net-worth.html>Carla Alapont Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./carla-alapont-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
