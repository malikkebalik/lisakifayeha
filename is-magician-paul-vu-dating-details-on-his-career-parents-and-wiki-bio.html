Vu said:</p><p>It was the single most astonishing moment of my life and it was that feeling of the impossible that made me so happy … it was something so small, but something that left a big impression on me that I have carried on for my entire life.&nbsp;It was just that one magic trick that led me on a path to become a magician.</p><p>Paul became a member of The Magic Castle in 2015 and appeared on British National Television in ITV1’s “The Next Great Magician.” He even auditioned for America’s Got Talent, but none of them made a great impact on his career.</p><p>With his brother’s advice, Paul started uploading his magic tricks on YouTube, but the result was not satisfactory.

Despite everything, “I still call him dad.”</p><p>While establishing his career as a magician, his parents were worried about him and his career: Paul said:</p><p>I told them in the middle of the school year, ‘Hey, I want to make videos, I can grow a following like this.
