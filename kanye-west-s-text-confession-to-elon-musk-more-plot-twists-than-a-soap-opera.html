<time>07 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>In a shocking twist that would put soap opera plotlines to shame, Kanye West recently dropped a bombshell in a text exchange with his pal Elon Musk.</p><p>Not only did he declare that he’s autistic, but he also sent out some interesting vibes about his mental health and family matters.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Kanye’s “Not Bipolar, But Autistic” Revelation</strong></h2><p>So, here’s Kanye, casually texting Elon like they’re discussing weekend plans. “When are we going to speak,” he starts, before swiftly clarifying that Elon doesn’t owe him a thing. But it’s when he gets to “I’m not bipolar” that our eyebrows raise. Instead, he states that he has “signs of autism” from a car crash back in 2002.</p><p>Hold on a second! Kanye, the music legend, fashion icon, and Twitter maverick, claiming he’s not bipolar? Well, that’s a plot twist. This guy was singing about “no one man should have all that power,” but it turns out he might just have a unique power after all – the ability to keep us all guessing.</p><p>Remember the Car Crash? You know, the one that gave us the epic “Through the Wire” track. Kanye thinks it’s responsible for these signs of autism he’s talking about. Now that’s a connection even the best soap opera writers would tip their hats to. Cue dramatic music.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Family Matters with a Dash of Kim Kardashian</strong></h2><p>Kanye didn’t stop there. He took a page right out of the “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” script.</p><p>He couldn’t help but bring up his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian. Apparently, he “can’t watch Kim keep my kids from me.” Now, that’s the kind of family drama we’ve come to expect from our favorite TV shows. Just add a dramatic pause and a “tune in next week to find out what happens!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Musk’s “Friendship” and the Social Media Saga</strong></h2><p>As if that wasn’t enough, Kanye had a bone to pick with his buddy <a href=# data-type=post_tag data-id=376>Elon Musk</a>. He accused Elon of using their “friendship” to attract his audience to Twitter, which he not-so-subtly referred to as a “struggling platform.” Well, at least Kanye didn’t hold back his feelings. It’s like a classic case of “I thought we were friends, but you’re just using me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/peepswiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Kanye-West-and-Elon-Musk-1024x576.jpg><p>The real twist is Kanye’s difficulty with social media, which is now revealed. In comparison to your favorite rollercoaster, he has experienced more ups and downs on these platforms. It is been a roller coaster of bans and suspensions.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember when Elon threatened to deactivate Kanye’s Twitter account? This was due to some contentious remarks, such as one about “going death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE.” But his Twitter hiatus was brief, and he is returned – albeit in a relatively quiet manner.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Car Crash That Changed Everything</strong></h2><p>The mystery surrounding Kanye’s claims that the 2002 car crash that gave birth to “Through the Wire” was the cause of his “autism signs” only deepens. You see, the accident was not just any accident; it was a life-altering accident. It is similar to the moment when the backstory of a TV character is revealed.</p><p>This is how it looks: Kanye crashes into another car on his way home from the recording studio after falling asleep at the wheel. His jaw? Completely shattered. He had to rap with his jaw wired shut. That’s a dedication to your art, right?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Ongoing Family Drama: More Twists and Turns Than a Soap Opera</strong></h2><p>The constant saga in Kanye’s life seems to be family drama. His pleading to see his children and the agony over his relationship with Kim Kardashian are a narrative arc that never ends.</p><p>It is that sort of material that keeps viewers glued to their screens while they wait for the next incident.</p><p>Kanye’s text confession is an example of the type of real-life drama that inspires TV dramas. Family conflicts, suspense, plot twists, and the occasional “wow, did not see that coming” are all present.</p><p>Who needs soap operas when we have the life and times of Kanye West? Tune in next time to see what new twists and turns await!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolZq9tMPIs2Wcp51kuaLAxKyrZqCfqXysrc2ynGavlajBbsDEsatmm5%2Bjs6a%2F0qKmp2WkpHqmuM6nZKato6B8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkanye-west-s-text-confession-to-elon-musk-more-plot-twists-than-a-soap-opera.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkanye-west-s-text-confession-to-elon-musk-more-plot-twists-than-a-soap-opera.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkanye-west-s-text-confession-to-elon-musk-more-plot-twists-than-a-soap-opera.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkanye-west-s-text-confession-to-elon-musk-more-plot-twists-than-a-soap-opera.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkanye-west-s-text-confession-to-elon-musk-more-plot-twists-than-a-soap-opera.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkanye-west-s-text-confession-to-elon-musk-more-plot-twists-than-a-soap-opera.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./madeleine-stowe.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./madeleine-stowe.html>Madeleine Stowe</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./is-carrie-underwood-getting-a-divorce-why-is-carrie-underwood-getting-a-divorce.html>Is Carrie Underwood Getting a Divorce?
