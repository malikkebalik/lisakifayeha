The opening lines of the song express the singer's disbelief at having to wear a suit and tie, an outfit not suited to his normal wild lifestyle. He admits to taking a pull to stop himself from crying. The church is packed with mourners bidding their friend farewell, and the singer acknowledges that though he has lived a wild life, he had amazing grace. The singer expresses his hope that his friend is enjoying himself in heaven, and that he is causing a ruckus there just as he did on Earth.</p><br><p>The chorus then imagines what heaven might be like for the deceased friend. The singer hopes his friend has a mansion with ten acres of land, mud, and hubs to lock in. He hopes his friend is making thunder and causing people to wonder about how he got in. He also hopes his friend is hiding his drinks from the man upstairs and playing his music loud.</p><br><p>The bridge of the song goes back to the day when the deceased friend became born again, and the singer was there to see it happen. He talks about heads being bowed and people singing "Just as I am." Despite the sadness of the loss, the singer expresses hope that he will see his friend again, but until then, he wants him to keep giving heaven some hell.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline
