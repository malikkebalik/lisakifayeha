Her birthplace is Scottsdale, Arizona (U.S.).</p><p>Maureen spent most of her childhood in Arizona. Besides, there is no official information regarding her parents, siblings, and family.</p><p>Even though Maureen is technically a celebrity, the world has no clue about her mysterious upbringing. The girl from Arizona, with a little spotlight in the media, later became a model for weight loss machines and worked in legal aid.</p><p>Although Blumhardt’s early life is an unexplored space, her educational background is not.</p><p>The blonde attended Villanova University, a private catholic university in Pennsylvania.</p><p>After that, with a degree in hand, the Arizonian embarked on acquiring another qualification with Columbia Journalism School.</p><p>Blumhardt’s educational pursuit piques one’s interest and proves she was an aspiring journalist.</p><h2><span id=Age_Height_Body_Measurements>Age, Height, & Body Measurements</span></h2><p>Born in&nbsp;1960&nbsp;makes, the beautiful lady 64 is&nbsp;years&nbsp;old.</p><p>Indeed, Maureen has come a long way since her early outings with her husband, Charles Barkley.</p><p>From photographs, it seemed as if both were enjoying their thrilling adult life.</p><p>As time passes, one day, you are freshly in love and still figuring out what to do with life, and the next thing you know, you are the mother to an adult daughter.</p><p>Nonetheless, the time has not managed to dent Maureen or her familial relationship.</p><p>Moving on, the Arizonian was once a model before establishing herself as a social worker.</p><p>In like manner, if she were to be a model, it is a wild guess that Maureen had a tall stature and probably followed the old-school fitness regimen.</p><p>Additionally, Blumhardt supposedly had an hourglass body figure during her youthful years, as did most models of the&nbsp;70s&nbsp;era.</p><p>Most importantly, the former model’s distinguishing features are her striking blue eyes, squared jawline, and, the obvious, her bright blonde hair.</p><h2><span id=Career_Humanitarian>Career: Humanitarian</span></h2><p>Initially, Maureen began her career as a model.</p><p>Accordingly, there were instances where some sources suggested that the blonde model appeared in commercials for&nbsp;Noblerex K-1,&nbsp;a type of body vibration machine.</p><p>Likewise, a hopeful model of her era generally transitioned into an acting career.</p><p>Even though Blumhardt repeatedly challenged herself to break into acting, her efforts were fruitless.</p><p>As a result, the Arizonians decided to stop following the path and instead ventured out to specific businesses.</p><p>In the meantime, Maureen would work as a legal aide, culminating in philanthropic activism.</p><p>Also, the Scottsdale native took the role of a lifetime honorary member of the&nbsp;Fresh Start Women’s Foundation.</p><p>The non-profit organization intensively worked to provide women a means to turn their lives around and influence them to undertake roles to bring about positive change.</p><h2><span id=Maureen_Blumhardt_Net_Worth>Maureen Blumhardt | Net Worth</span></h2><p>In particular, as a model and a businesswoman, Blumhardt accumulated an acknowledgeable net worth.</p><p>Even though we know her professional involvement, there is no way to figure out the exact sum of her earnings.</p><p>In contrast, Charles Barkley is a notable&nbsp;NBA&nbsp;player whose career spans&nbsp;16 years&nbsp;with three of the most impressive teams at that time. Hence, the Alabamian has a fantastic net worth of&nbsp;<strong>$40 million.</strong></p><p>To illustrate, this kind of money did not materialize from his basketball career alone.</p><p>After successfully concluding a glorious career, Barkley accepted the role of a studio pundit for&nbsp;Turner Network Television (TNT).</p><p>Furthermore, to add to his massive fortune, Charles had endorsements from reputed companies like&nbsp;Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Nike, Right Guard,&nbsp;and&nbsp;T-Mobile.</p><p>Besides, his job at&nbsp;TNT&nbsp;reportedly pays him&nbsp;<strong>$1.5 million</strong>&nbsp;yearly.</p><p>Nevertheless, with abundant wealth, it’s only likely to enjoy the finer things life has in store.</p><p>And by store, we mean literal store, as Charles went all out and purchased&nbsp;Lincoln Navigator&nbsp;and&nbsp;Bentley&nbsp;and resides in Scottsdale’s mansion, costing&nbsp;<strong>$2.5 million</strong>.</p><h2><span id=Maureen_Blumhardt_Charles_Barkley_Wife_Kids>Maureen Blumhardt: Charles Barkley Wife | Kids</span></h2><p>The love that Blumhardt and Barkley have is genuinely out of fairytales. For instance, being of different racial backgrounds, the two formed a unity that noon in that period would fathom.</p><p>Also, Maureen and Charles first crossed paths in&nbsp;1989&nbsp;when they resided in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, for some time. Additionally, the two were having a meal at City Avenue, and suddenly, their eyes met.</p><p>From that moment on, the two knew the other had to be the one and started a friendly conversation.</p><p>Eventually, that conversation led to a date, and Maureen and Charles were head over heels for each other after a few dates.</p><p>Subsequently, word got out that the two were in a relationship, and instantly faced harsh criticism for their decisions.</p><p>But, despite all odds, love always finds a way; it always prevails. So was the case with the lovebirds.</p><p>Likewise, in&nbsp;1989,&nbsp;with the parents’ approval and in the presence of the people who loved and supported their union, the two exchanged vows.</p><p>In no time, the couple announced their first and only child, a daughter,&nbsp;<strong>Christianna Barkley.&nbsp;</strong>In like manner, Christianna inherited her father’s strength and her mother’s beauty.</p><p>Simultaneously, being born into affluence and with a celebrated father didn’t deviate from her goals as she pursued journalism at the Columbia Journalism School.</p><h2><span id=Charles_Barkley_Some_Famous_Quotes>Charles Barkley | Some Famous Quotes</span></h2><i>My initial response was to sue her for defamation of character, but then I realized I had no feeling.</i> <i>The only difference between a good and bad shot is whether it goes in or not.</i> <i>My family got all over me because they said Bush is only for the rich people.
