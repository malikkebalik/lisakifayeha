He also revealed how emotional he had been as they filmed, stating that he usually created a forcefield to protect himself. Still, it barely keeps his eyes from watering now and then.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/42d6fba988b97bb09f563671ce3f8d6d.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>This Is Us Season 6 Red Carpet, December 14th, 2021 in Los Angeles -- Pictured: Carolyn Cassidy, Dan Fogelman, Lisa Katz. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>He was not the only one who felt that way about Rebecca’s ending. Nearly all the cast members did, including Mandy Moore, who admitted that she “threw up after reading” what would be played out.</p><p class=dh>Moore described the train metaphor as a “beautiful and all-encompassing way to showcase someone’s life at the very end.”</p><p class=dh>She also stated that she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://ew.com/tv/this-is-us-mandy-moore-breaks-down-rebecca-train-ride/>reached </a>out to Fogelman after she finished reading to tell him how honored she was to be a part of the story.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/09a133bf0f0c5b16864deaaae805c45f.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Milo Ventimiglia, Chrissy Metz, Chris Geere, Griffin Dunne, Caitlin Thompson, Chris Sullivan, Carolyn Cassidy, Mandy Moore, Susan Kelechi Watson, Asante Blackk, Dan Fogelman,Jon Huertas, Justin Hartley, Lisa Katz, Eris Baker, Sterling K.

After the emotional trip viewers were taken on in the penultimate episode, many expect a smooth wrap-up, and according to Moore, it is most likely what they will get.</p><p class=dh>Fogelman has revealed that he will miss the show and has even likened it to a baby he raised and now has to let go.</p><p class=dh>However, when asked about spinoffs, Fogelman says that there may be no simply because, by the time the last episode airs, fans will already know most of what they need to about how the characters will fare later on.
