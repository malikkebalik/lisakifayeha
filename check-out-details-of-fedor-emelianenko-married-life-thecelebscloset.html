<time>16 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>MMA remains one of the most beloved sports as of 2019. With several heart-pumping matches, fans are sure to get an adrenaline rush every time a perfect hook connects or a kick presses down the opponent.</p><p>The world of MMA has introduced several fighters to the world. Some get the ultimate limelight in their initial years and fade away as time goes by. But, not <strong>Fedor Emelianenko</strong>. He is someone that still gets respected by the MMA participants be it fighters, managers, or spectators.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Peek_Into_Fedor%E2%80%99s_Personal_Life></span>A Peek Into Fedor’s Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Fedor explored his love and marital relationships with three partners over the years. His first and foremost marriage dates back to 1999. The guy married his longtime girlfriend <strong>Oksana</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Fedor-and-Oksana.jpg><p>The duo had known each other from their school days which gave them enough time to get accustomed to each other. They shared their company for seven long years and decided to part ways in 2006. They share a daughter, <strong>Masha</strong> <strong>Emelianenko</strong>.</p><p>With his high-school gone, the fighter added a new girl to his romantic timeline. She is none other than <strong>Marina</strong> whom he married later on. They publicly complimented each other on parties and were spotted cuddling in private.</p><p>The couple welcomed their third member, a daughter named <strong>Vasilisa</strong> <strong>Emelianenko</strong> on the 29th of December, 2007. With a girl to strengthen their parenting bonds, the duo decided to tie their holy knot in October of 2009. Two years later in July, the lovebirds were blessed with another kid, a lovely daughter named <strong>Elizaveta Emelianenko</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Fedor-and-jackson.jpg><p>Fedor and his second wife stayed together for four lovely years and sadly got divorced in 2014. The reasons for their crumbling marriage are not known to this day and both the partners refrain from disclosing the matter with the public.</p><p>“What goes around comes around”. Such became the case for Fedor’s first marriage. As surprising as it may sound, the MMA fighter remarried his first wife Oksana in 2014. They exchanged their vows in the Russian Orthodox Church located at Stary Oskol. To date, they are still together.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_much_Does_the_Fighter_Earn></span>How much Does the Fighter Earn?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Fedor Emelianenko boasts a total net worth of <strong>$18</strong> <strong>million</strong>. But, on 2012, he only had around <strong>$10 million </strong>as his total fortune. He is currently active as a politician and is a celebrated former MMA athlete.</p><p><strong>Never Miss: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Miss Universe Cambodia 2019 Somnang Alyna Earned Her Worth Through Modeling! (opens in a new tab)" href=#>Miss Universe Cambodia 2019 Somnang Alyna Earned Her Worth Through Modeling!</a></strong></p><p>The main contribution to his wealth comes from his years of serving as a mixed martial arts artist and champions he pocketed during the time. Some of his highest-paid fights include his brawl against <strong>Maldonado</strong>(earned <strong>$2,000,000</strong>) and the Rizin World Grand Prix 2015 final(earned <strong>$2,200,000</strong>).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Fedor’s career ascent started from his 2003 fight against Brazil’s <strong>Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira</strong>. He beat his opponent and grabbed the title of second-ever Pride Heavyweight Champion.</p><p>The 6 feet athlete won his first World Alliance of MMA Heavyweight Championship title in 2008, after knocking down his opponent ex-UFC Champ <strong>Tim Sylvia </strong>under a minute of the start of the game.</p><p>From there, the reign of Fedor started making him one of the most renowned mixed martial artists of the generation. He remained undefeated for almost a decade and won countless tournaments and accolades during that time.</p><p>The Ukranian-born athlete grabbed the Pride 2004 Grand Prix and also the World Combat Sambo championship. Often remembered as The Last Emperor in the boxing ring, the guy also received a gold medal during the Russian national Judo championship.</p><p>The genius among the athletes announced his retirement from the sport in June of 2012. On his journey, he got supported by major publications which included big names like Sports Illustrated, USA Today, and Sherdog.com. He contributed to the sport afterward as a President of the Russian MMA Union.</p><p><strong>Also, See: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="How did Bryce Drummond Come to Fame? (opens in a new tab)" href=#>How did Bryce Drummond Come to Fame?</a></strong></p><p>The ex- fearsome fighter had already started his political journey from October of 2010. He started as the deputy of the Belgorod Regional Duma under the political party named United Russia.</p><p>The Russian-bred fighter served under the post for five years and moved on to replace the Russian Prime Minister <strong>Dmitry Medvedev</strong> to grab the position of Russia’s Council of Physical Fitness and Sports on the 28th of July, 2012.</p><p>Fedor returned to the arena on the 14th of July, 2015 after a three years hiatus. He maintained a record of 5 wins and 2 losses until his retirement just days before the end of 2019. In his final match against the <strong>Quinton “Rampage” Jackson</strong>, Fedor won by TKO at the Saitama Super Arena, Japan. The match was just 2 minutes and 44 seconds long and ended in the first round.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Quick_Facts_Fedor_Emelianenko></span>Quick Facts: Fedor Emelianenko<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Fedor is considered the best in his craft with his 10 years of undefeated history.</li><li>He started his Judo Training from the small age of twelve.</li><li>The fighter is friends with <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Vladimir Putin (opens in a new tab)">Vladimir Putin</a></strong>, the Russian President and has served under him.</li><li>UFC pursued the Russian fighter for a long time and tried to get him in a match against Brock Lesnar.</li><li>In 2008, the reigning president of the U.S planned A Fighting Fedor Reality Show.</li></ul><p>For more celebrity-related content, visit <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="TheCelebsCloset (opens in a new tab)">TheCelebsCloset</a></strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwprjEm6qcpJ%2BosrV6wqikaJ6VmbyzecSmnKWhkaOyr7fOZqSaqqKesqV5y6Kdnmc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcheck-out-details-of-fedor-emelianenko-married-life-thecelebscloset.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcheck-out-details-of-fedor-emelianenko-married-life-thecelebscloset.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcheck-out-details-of-fedor-emelianenko-married-life-thecelebscloset.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcheck-out-details-of-fedor-emelianenko-married-life-thecelebscloset.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcheck-out-details-of-fedor-emelianenko-married-life-thecelebscloset.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcheck-out-details-of-fedor-emelianenko-married-life-thecelebscloset.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./cole-swider-parents-wiki-biography-age-siblings-wife-rank-position-career-net-worth-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./cole-swider-parents-wiki-biography-age-siblings-wife-rank-position-career-net-worth-more.html>Cole Swider Parents, Wiki, Biography, Age, Siblings, Wife, Rank, Position, Career, Net Worth &amp;amp; More.</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ahmad-jamal-mcghee-net-worth.html>Ahmad Jamal McGhee Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ahmad-jamal-mcghee-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
