He was born on September 30, 1988 in Irvine, California to James and Cynthia Williams.</p><p>Did you know De’Wonte, Mankie, Carter, Ari, Taye, or Keon? No matter which one you knew, he was a kind and caring person who loved to be around great and positive vibes. His pursuits in life were driven by his keen and inquisitive nature. The simplest pleasures in life brought great joy to Mankie’s life. He truly enjoyed the presence of his family & friends and was the life of the party. Mankie had an entrepreneurial-spirited and constantly strived for greatness throughout his life. He was a go-getter, especially when the going got tough. If something did not work out in his favor, he was not afraid to adjust his plan or move on to his next goal. Even when life got tough for him, he maintained his motivation and defeated any and all obstacles he encountered. Whatever Mankie did, he was all in and whatever Mankie set out to accomplish he achieved.</p><p>Mankie had such an infectious smile and outgoing personality. His presence and demeanor were contagious. For that very reason, he never met a stranger and once you met him you were a friend for life. One thing for sure, Mankie kept everyone rolling in laughter. Between his trash talking (which he did a lot) and finding humor in the most mundane situations – it was never a dull moment with him!</p><p>Mankie enjoyed traveling, being in the company of the ones he loved, game nights, eating, cooking for family and friends and was always willing to embark on new adventures. The one thing you may not have known, but suspected, was that Mankie was a very blunt person. No sugar coating allowed. He was direct and to the point. You didn’t have to ask him, he just volunteered his unsolicited opinions. It was always done with pure love, compassion, and him wanting the best for you. Leave it to Mankie, what needed to be said, was going to come straight from his mouth to your ears. His authenticity set him apart from others. He showed you himself through the good, bad, or ugly. 5 minutes around him seemed like forever.</p><p>The pain of his death is not something that can’t just go away. What makes it bearable is knowing that he touched so many lives and was loved by all. We all have the wonderful memories he left with us. He was such a great friend, loving son, protective brother, and an even better confidant – he leaves a stamp on all of our hearts. He left us a part of him that neither time nor death can take away, his love.</p><p>“And be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving one another, just as God also, forgave you in Christ.”</p><p>Ephesians 4:32</p><p>De’Wonte Tashad Carter, leaves to cherish his memory: mother, Cynthia Williams of Saginaw, MI; father, James Williams of Chicago, IL; Grandmother Earnestine Griffin of Greenville, MS; sisters, Dominicia Williams, Rynata Leach, and Lewisha Acevedo; niece, Ava Santiful; aunts, Marsha (Lemuel) Riddick, Treva Miles, Vernell (Jimmy) Kilpatrick, Leonia Valley, Sabrenia Williams, Ebony (Rashadd) Coleman; uncles, Rodney Howard, Frankie Riche, Demetrius Valley, Deshone (Kenda) Valley, Adrian (Inger) Griffin, Melvin Griffin, Christopher Griffin; beloved family, friends, and a host of cousins.</p><p>“Mankie” was preceded in death by his grandparents, Slyvester and Daisy Valley; uncle, Ricky Riche; cousins, Mi’Angel Riche, Devon Holmes, Caquanton Holmes, and Ricky Riche Jr.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillam%2FsLzOpaCtmZ6bwq%2Bx0ZqjrJ2iq7aksY2cpqZnnZq6sL7ImqNonJWsvK%2FAxGarZpuRp8GmvoymmKejmZp8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdewonte-t-carter-mankie-metropolitan-funeral.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdewonte-t-carter-mankie-metropolitan-funeral.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdewonte-t-carter-mankie-metropolitan-funeral.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdewonte-t-carter-mankie-metropolitan-funeral.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdewonte-t-carter-mankie-metropolitan-funeral.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdewonte-t-carter-mankie-metropolitan-funeral.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./fawaz-al-qarni-football-goalkeeper-news-stats-bio-and-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./fawaz-al-qarni-football-goalkeeper-news-stats-bio-and-more.html>Fawaz Al Qarni - Football Goalkeeper - News, Stats, Bio and more</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./details-about-youtube-car-age-accident-bio-the-talks-today.html>Details About YouTube, Car, Age, Accident, Bio The Talks Today</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./details-about-youtube-car-age-accident-bio-the-talks-today.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
